102\r\niv\r\n1. Game Concepts\r\n1.0. General\r\n1.0.1. The rules in this document apply to any game of Flesh and Blood.\r\n1.0.1a If an effect directly contradicts a rule contained in this document, the effect supersedes that rule.\r\n1.0.1b If a tournament rule contradicts a rule contained in this document or an effect, the tournament\r\nrule supersedes that rule or that effect.\r\n1.0.2. A rule or effect that states something can not happen takes precedence over any rule and/or effect that\r\nstates that something can happen, subject to Rule 1.0.1a.\r\nExample: If one effect reads “You can’t play cards from your banished zone.” and another effect\r\nreads “You may play cards from your banished zone.”, the former effect takes precedence and the\r\nplayer can not play cards from their banished zone.\r\n1.0.2a A rule or effect that states that “only” something can happen, is functionally equivalent to a rule\r\nor effect that states everything else can not happen.\r\nExample: Three of a Kind has the text “[...] you may only play cards from arsenal.”, which is\r\nequivalent to “you can not play cards from anywhere other than arsenal.”. Even if an effect\r\nwould allow you to play a card from your banished zone, you would not be able to play that\r\ncard from the banished zone because of the effect generated by Three of a Kind.\r\n1.1. Players\r\n1.1.1. A player is a person participating in the game.\r\n1.1.1a To participate, a person must have a hero, a card-pool, a way to represent any tokens and counters\r\nthat could be created by effects in their card-pool, a way to generate uniform random values for\r\neffects in their card-pool, a play-space, and a method to record life totals.\r\n1.1.2. A player’s hero is a hero card.\r\n1.1.2a This document distinguishes the player as the person participating in the game and the hero as\r\nthe hero card of a player.\r\n1.1.2b A player plays the game as their hero. Card text makes no distinction between the player and\r\ntheir hero, identifying both identically; the term “you” refers to the player’s hero and the term\r\n“opponent” refers to the player’s opponent’s hero.\r\n1.1.3. A player’s card-pool is a collection of non-hero cards. A card can only be included in a player’s card\u0002pool if the card’s supertypes are a subset of their hero’s supertypes. (See Section 2.10 - Supertypes)\r\nExample: If the hero card is Boltyn (supertypes of “Light” and “Warrior”), the card-pool can only\r\ninclude cards with the supertypes of “Light Warrior”, “Light”, “Warrior”, and cards with no\r\nsupertypes (“Generic”).\r\n1\r\nCHAPTER 1. GAME CONCEPTS\r\n1.1.3a If an effect allows a player to start the game with one or more cards with supertypes that are not\r\na subset of their hero’s supertypes, those cards may be included in the player’s card-pool as long\r\nas they start the game as specified by the effect (see Rule 4.1.6c). Card text of meta-static abilities\r\nrefers to the player’s card-pool as the player’s “deck”.\r\n1.1.3b A hybrid card may be included in a player’s card-pool if either of the hybrid card’s supertype sets\r\nis a subset of their hero’s supertypes. (See Rule 2.12.1b)\r\n1.1.4. A player’s play-space is an area for designated zones owned by (and shared with) the player. (See\r\nChapter 3 - Zones)\r\n1.1.5. In a game, a player’s opponents include all other players.\r\n1.1.6. Clockwise order is the order of players starting from the given player and progressing clockwise\r\namong the players when viewed from above. The next player in clockwise order is the player to the left\r\nof the given player.\r\n1.2. Objects\r\n1.2.1. An object is a card, token, macro, or layer in the game.\r\n1.2.2. A permanent is a card or token in the arena that is designated as a permanent by a rule or effect.\r\n1.2.2a A permanent remains a permanent until it leaves the arena.\r\n1.2.3. Objects have one or more properties. (See Chapter 2 - Object Properties)\r\n1.2.4. An object has one or more object identities that can be referred to. Rules in this document and effects\r\ntypically describe objects using their object identity as the noun.\r\nExample: Lunging Press has the text “Target attack action card gains +1{p}.”, which identifies the\r\ntarget of the effect, using the “card” object identity as the noun.\r\n1.2.4a An object has the object identity “object”.\r\n1.2.4b An object with a name property and/or moniker has the object identity of that name and/or\r\nmoniker. (See Section 2.6 - Name)\r\nExample: Dorinthea, Quicksilver Prodigy has the text “The first time Dawnblade, Resplendent\r\ngains go again each turn, [...]”, which identifies an object using the name “Dawnblade,\r\nResplendent” as an object identity.\r\n1.2.4c A card or token has the object identity of its types and subtypes, except for the subtype attack.\r\nExample: Ironsong Determination has the text “Target weapon gains +1{p} and dominate\r\nuntil end-of turn.”, which identifies an object using the type “weapon” as an object identity.\r\n1.2.4d A card with the subtype attack on the stack, an attack-proxy on the stack, an attack-layer on the\r\nstack, or an attacking object on the combat chain has the object identity “attack”. (See Rule 7.0.2)\r\n2\r\nCHAPTER 1. GAME CONCEPTS\r\nExample: Oath of the Arknight has the text “Your next Runeblade attack this turn gains\r\n+3{p}.”, which identifies either a Runeblade attack action card on the stack, or attack-proxy\r\ncreated by a Runeblade source, or an attacking Runeblade object; using “attack” as an object\r\nidentity.\r\n1.2.4e A card has the object identity “card”.\r\n1.2.4f A token has the object identity “token”.\r\n1.2.4g An activated-layer has the object identity “activated ability”.\r\n1.2.4h A triggered-layer has the object identity “triggered effect”.\r\n1.2.5. Last known information (LKI) about an object is a snapshot of the state of an object immediately\r\nbefore it ceased to exist.\r\n1.2.5a If a rule or effect requires information about a specific object that no longer exists, instead it uses\r\nlast known information about that object to fulfil that requirement. Otherwise, if a rule or effect does\r\nnot specifically refer to that object, last known information is not used.\r\nExample: Endless Arrow has the text “When Endless Arrow hits, put it into your hand.”. If\r\nEndless Arrow hits, it is put into the player’s hand. The chain link of Endless Arrow then holds\r\nthe last known information about Endless Arrow, so that if it had the ability “go again” before\r\nit was put into hand the player would still gain an action point when the link step begins.\r\n1.2.5b Last known information about an object includes all parameters, history, and effects applicable to\r\nthat object at the time it still existed.\r\n1.2.5c Last known information about an object is immutable - it can not be altered. Rules and effects\r\nthat would modify the object that no longer exists do not modify the last known information about\r\nan object; this may cause effects to fail.\r\nExample: Luminaris has the text “If there is a yellow card in your pitch zone, Illusionist\r\nattacks you control have go again.”. If you controlled an Illusionist attack as a chain link on\r\nthe combat chain, but it was removed, and then you put a yellow card in your pitch zone to\r\nmeet Luminaris’s condition, the chain link does not have go again because the last known\r\ninformation about the attack can not be altered.\r\n1.2.5d Last known information about an object is not an object itself - it is not a legal target for rules\r\nand effects.\r\n1.2.6. The owner of an object is the same as the card, token, macro, or layer that represents it, otherwise it\r\nhas no owner.\r\n1.2.7. The controller of an object is the same as the card, token, macro, or layer that represents it. An object\r\ndoes not have a controller if it is not in the arena or on the stack.\r\n1.3. Cards\r\n1.3.1. A card is represented by an official Flesh and Blood card, which is defined by tournament rules.\r\n3\r\nCHAPTER 1. GAME CONCEPTS\r\n1.3.1a The properties of a card are determined by the properties printed on the latest version of the\r\nofficial Flesh and Blood card that represents it, or as specified by any errata published by Legend\r\nStory Studios, whichever is most recent. These properties are the copyable properties of the card.\r\n(See Chapter 2 - Object Properties)\r\n1.3.1b A deck-card is a card that can start the game in a player’s deck and has one of the following\r\nprinted types: Action, Attack Reaction, Defense Reaction, Instant, Mentor, and Resource. An\r\narena-card is any card that can not start the game in a player’s deck and has one of the following\r\nprinted types: Equipment, Weapon.\r\n1.3.2. A card is distinct from another card if it has a different name or pitch from that other card.\r\nExample: Sink Below with 1 pitch (and a red color bar) is distinct from Sink Below with 2 pitch\r\n(and a yellow color bar).\r\n1.3.3. The owner of a card is the player who started the game with that card as their hero or as part of their\r\ncard-pool, or the player instructed to create it or otherwise put it into the game.\r\n1.3.4. The controller of a card is its owner as it enters the arena or the player who played that card.\r\n1.4. Tokens\r\n1.4.1. A token is any permanent in the arena that is neither a card nor a macro. Tokens are created by effects.\r\n1.4.1a A token is not a card, even if it is represented by an official Flesh and Blood card. (See Rule\r\n1.3.1)\r\nExample: The official Flesh and Blood card Quicken is a token. This is indicated by the term\r\n“token” printed in the type box.\r\n1.4.1b The properties of a token are defined by the effect that created it - these properties are the\r\ncopyable properties of the token. (See Section 8.6 - Token Keywords)\r\n1.4.1c A token is not considered part of a player’s card-pool. (See Rule 1.1.3)\r\n1.4.2. If a token leaves the arena and it is not a sub-object, it ceases to exist. (See Rule 3.0.14)\r\n1.4.3. The owner of a token is the player instructed to create it.\r\n1.4.4. The controller of a token is its owner as it enters the arena.\r\n1.5. Macros\r\n1.5.1. A macro is an object in the arena that is neither a card nor a token. Macros are objects used to generate\r\nstatic-continuous effects that exist over two or more turns or indefinitely.\r\n1.5.1a A macro is not a card, even if it is represented by an official Flesh and Blood card. (See Rule\r\n1.3.1)\r\n1.5.1b The properties of a macro are defined by the rule or effect that created it.\r\n1.5.1c A macro is not considered part of a player’s deck. (See Rule 1.1.3)\r\n4\r\nCHAPTER 1. GAME CONCEPTS\r\n1.5.2. If a macro leaves the arena, it ceases to exist.\r\n1.5.3. The owner of a macro is the player instructed to create it.\r\n1.5.4. The controller of a macro is its owner as it enters the arena.\r\n1.6. Layers\r\n1.6.1. A layer is an object on the stack (see Section 3.14 - Stack) that is yet to be resolved. A layer is\r\nrepresented by a card or is an object created by an ability or effect.\r\n1.6.1a A card-layer is a layer represented by a card on the stack.\r\n1.6.1b An activated-layer is a layer created by an activated ability. An activated-layer can only exist on\r\nthe stack. (See Section 5.2 - Activated Abilities)\r\nExample: Energy Potion has the text “Instant – Destroy Energy Potion: Gain {r}{r}”, which\r\nis an activated ability. When this ability is activated, it creates an activated-layer on the stack\r\nwith the resolution ability “Gain {r}{r}”.\r\n1.6.1c A triggered-layer is a layer created by a triggered effect. A triggered-layer can only exist on the\r\nstack. (See Section 6.6 - Triggered Effects)\r\nExample: Snatch has the text “When Snatch hits, draw a card.”, which is a triggered effect.\r\nWhen this effect is triggered, it creates a triggered-layer to be put on the stack with the\r\nresolution ability “Draw a card”.\r\n1.6.2. An attack-proxy is an activated-layer (activated-attack) or triggered-layer (triggered-attack) with the\r\nattack ability (see Rule 8.3.1), and represents its source as an attack on the stack before the source\r\nbecomes a chain link on the combat chain.\r\nExample: Bone Basher has the text, “Once per Turn Action – {r}{r}: Attack” which is an\r\nactivated ability that creates an attack-proxy, because it is an activated-layer with the attack ability.\r\n1.6.2a An attack-proxy is an extension of its source. The attack-proxy is considered to be its source for\r\nrules and effects unless otherwise specified by a rule.\r\nExample: Sharpen Steel has the text “Your next weapon attack this turn gains +3{p}.”, which\r\nis an effect that applies only to the next weapon attack. If you create an attack-proxy with a\r\nweapon, Sharpen Steel’s effect will apply to the attack-proxy because it is considered to be a\r\nweapon (and an attack) for rules and effects.\r\n1.6.2b An attack-proxy is considered a separate object from its source for effects that applies\r\nspecifically to attacks. Effects that refer to and apply to the source also refer to and apply to any\r\nattack-proxy created by the source, but effects that specifically refer to or apply to the attack-proxy\r\ndo not refer to or apply to the source.\r\nExample: Sharpen Steel has the text “Your next weapon attack this turn gains +3{p}.”, which\r\napplies only to the attack-proxy created by a weapons abilities and then applies to the weapon\r\nas an attack on the combat chain; it does not continue to apply to the weapon when the weapon\r\nis no longer that specific attack on the combat chain.\r\n5\r\nCHAPTER 1. GAME CONCEPTS\r\nExample: Ironsong Determination has the text “Target weapon gains +1{p} and dominate\r\nuntil end of turn.”, which applies to a weapon object, and by extension, any attack-proxies\r\ncreated by its abilities.\r\n1.6.3. An attack-layer is a layer with the attack effect (see Rule 8.5.33), and represents an attack with no\r\nproperties on the stack before the object specified by the attack effect becomes a chain link on the\r\ncombat chain.\r\nExample: Emperor, Dracai of Aesir has the text “Action – {r}{r}{r}: Search your deck for\r\nCommand and Conquer, attack with it, then shuffle.”, which is an activated ability that creates an\r\nattack-layer, because it is an activated-layer with the attack effect.\r\n1.6.3a An attack-layer is not an extension of its attack-source. For the purposes of effects, the attack\u0002layer is considered to be either a typical layer or an attack with no properties, but not both.\r\nExample: The attack-layer created by Emperor, Dracai of Aesir is considered to be either a\r\nRoyal Draconic Warrior Wizard Hero activated-layer or an attack for the purposes of effects. It\r\nis not a Royal Draconic Warrior Wizard Hero activated ability attack. Uprising has the text\r\n“Your next 4 Draconic attacks this turn gain +1{p}”, which is a continuous effect that would\r\nnot apply to this attack-layer because it is not considered a Draconic attack.\r\n1.6.3b An attack-layer is considered a separate object from its attack-source for an effect that applies\r\nspecifically to attacks. If an effect does not apply to an attack layer, it may still apply to the attack\u0002source if it meets the specifications of the effect.\r\n1.6.4. The owner of a card-layer is the player who owns the card. The owner of an activated-layer is the\r\nplayer who activated the activated ability. The owner of a triggered-layer is the player who controlled the\r\nsource of the triggered effect when the triggered-layer was created.\r\n1.6.5. The controller of a layer is the player that put it on the stack.\r\n1.7. Abilities\r\n1.7.1. An ability is a property of an object that influences the game by generating effects or by creating a\r\nlayer on the stack that resolves and generates effects.\r\n1.7.2. The base abilities of a card are determined by its rules text. (See Section 2.11 - Text Box)\r\n1.7.3. The base abilities of a token, macro, or layer are defined by the rule, effect, or ability that created it.\r\n1.7.4. There are three categories of abilities: activated abilities, resolution abilities, and static abilities. An\r\nability is categorized based on how it generates effects.\r\n1.7.4a Activated abilities can be activated by a player to put an activated-layer on the stack. (See\r\nSection 5.2 - Activated Abilities)\r\n1.7.4b Resolution abilities generate effects when a layer with the ability resolves on the stack. (See\r\nSection 5.3 - Resolution Abilities & Resolving Layers)\r\n1.7.4c Static abilities simply generate effects. (See Section 5.4 - Static Abilities)\r\n6\r\nCHAPTER 1. GAME CONCEPTS\r\n1.7.5. An activated ability can only be activated when it is functional. A resolution or static ability only\r\ngenerates its effects when it is functional. An ability is functional when its source is public and in the\r\narena; otherwise, it is non-functional, with the following exceptions:\r\n1.7.5a An ability of a non-permanent defending object (see Rule 3.5.4d) is non-functional unless the\r\nability is an activated ability that specifies it can be activated when the object is defending, a\r\ntriggered ability with a trigger condition that includes the object defending, or a static ability that is\r\nstated as an exception.\r\nExample: Rally the Rearguard has the text “Once per Turn Instant — Discard a card: Rally\r\nthe Rearguard gains +3 {d} . Activate this ability only while Rally the Rearguard is\r\ndefending.”, which is functional when it is a non-permanent defending card because the\r\nactivated ability states it can only be activated when the card is defending.\r\n1.7.5b An activated ability that specifies it can be activated when its source is private and/or in a zone\r\noutside the arena is functional when the source meets that condition. (See Rule 5.2.4)\r\nExample: Guardian of the Shadowrealm has the text “Action - {r}{r}: Return Guardian of the\r\nShadowrealm to your hand. Active this ability only while Guardian of the Shadowrealm is in\r\nyour banished zone.”, which is functional when it is in the owner’s banished zone.\r\n1.7.5c A resolution ability is functional when its source object resolves as a layer on the stack,\r\notherwise, it is non-functional. (See Section 5.3 - Resolution Abilities & Resolving Layers)\r\nExample: Sigil of Solace has the text “Gain 3{h}”, which is a resolution ability that is\r\nfunctional as the card resolves as a layer on the stack to produce its effect.\r\n1.7.5d A meta-static ability is functional outside the game. (See Rule 5.4.3)\r\nExample: The Specialization keyword is a meta-static ability that prevents the player from\r\nincluding the card in their deck if the specialization does not match their hero card’s first\r\nname, which is functional outside the game.\r\n1.7.5e A play-static ability is functional when its source is public in any zone and when it is played.\r\n(See Rule 5.4.4)\r\nExample: Ghostly Visit has the text “You may play Ghostly Visit from your banished zone.”,\r\nwhich is a play-static ability that is functional when playing Ghostly Visit, because it affects the\r\nrules of how it is allowed to be played.\r\n1.7.5f A property-static ability is functional when its source is in any zone or outside the game. (See\r\nRule 5.4.5)\r\nExample: The {p} and {d} of Mutated Mass are defined by a property-static ability which is\r\nfunctional at all times, based on the current total number of different costed cards in the pitch\r\nzone in the current game state.\r\n1.7.5g A while-static ability is functional when its while-condition is met. (See Rule 5.4.7)\r\nExample: Yinti Yanti has the text “While Yinti Yanti is defending and you control an aura, it\r\nhas +1 {d} .”, which is a while-static ability that is functional when it is a non-permanent\r\ndefending card because it has a while-condition that is met when the card is defending.\r\n1.7.5h A static ability is functional when its source resolves as a layer on the stack and/or as its source\r\nenters the arena.\r\n7\r\nCHAPTER 1. GAME CONCEPTS\r\nExample: Conduit of Frostburn has the text “The next card you play this turn with an effect\r\nthat deals arcane damage gains ‘When this deals arcane damage to a hero, [...]’ ”, which gives\r\na card a static ability that is functional when its source resolves as a layer on the stack.\r\n1.7.5i A triggered-static ability, with a triggered condition that its source is outside the arena, is\r\nfunctional when the source meets that condition.\r\nExample: Back Alley Breakline has the text “When an activated ability or action card effect\r\nputs Back Alley Breakline face up into a zone from your deck, gain 1 action point.”, which is a\r\ntriggered-static ability that is functional when an activated ability or action card effect puts it\r\ninto that zone from the deck.\r\n1.7.5j A static ability, with a replacement effect that modifies the event of its source moving zones, is\r\nfunctional when the source meets that condition.\r\nExample: Drone of Brutality has the text “If Drone of Brutality would be put into your\r\ngraveyard from anywhere, instead put it on the bottom of your deck.”, which is a static ability\r\nwith a replacement effect that is functional when Drone of Brutality would be moved to the\r\ngraveyard zone.\r\n1.7.6. A modal ability is a resolution ability that contains a choice of modes for what abilities the source has,\r\nor what effects the ability will generate. A modal ability typically contains the phrase “choose [X]\r\n[CONDITIONS?]; [MODES]” where X is a cardinal number or a description of the number of modes to\r\nchoose, CONDITIONS (if any) specifies one or more conditions for selecting modes, and MODES is a\r\nlist of modes that can be selected.\r\n1.7.6a Modes of an ability are declared as the source card, activated-layer, or triggered-layer is added as\r\na layer on the stack. (See Rule 5.1.4 and Rule 6.6.6a)\r\n1.7.6b If the ability allows the player to select two or more modes, they can not select the same mode\r\nmore than once, unless specified by the ability.\r\nExample: Art of War has the text “Choose 2; [...]” followed by four modal options. Because\r\nthe ability does not state that the player can choose the same option more than once, two\r\ndistinct modes must be selected.\r\n1.7.6c If the same mode is selected more than once, the modes are considered separate and do not create\r\na compound event (See Rule 1.9.2). If the mode contains a targeted effect, the same target(s) may be\r\nselected for each time the mode is selected.\r\nExample: Blood on Her Hands has the text “Target 1H weapon has +1{p} while attacking this\r\nturn.”, which is a mode that can be selected more than once. As a targeted effect, the player\r\nmay target the same 1H weapon each time it is chosen as a mode.\r\n1.7.6d Once the modes of a modal ability have been selected, those modes determine the abilities/effects\r\nof the source for rules and effects.\r\n1.7.7. A connected ability pair is a pair of abilities where the parameters and/or events of one connected\r\nability (leading ability) are specifically referred to by the effect(s) of the other connected ability\r\n(following ability).\r\n8\r\nCHAPTER 1. GAME CONCEPTS\r\nExample: Reckless Swing has the text “As an additional cost to play Reckless Swing, discard a\r\nrandom card.”, which is a leading play-static ability that requires the player to discard a card, and\r\n“If the discarded card has 6 or more Attack, deal 2 damage to the attacking hero.”, which is a\r\nfollowing resolution ability with an effect that directly refers to the card discarded from the event\r\ngenerated by an effect in the leading ability.\r\n1.7.7a An ability can be part of one or more connected ability pairs. An ability can be both a leading\r\nand following ability for different connected ability pairs.\r\n1.7.7b If a following ability can not refer to the parameters and/or events of the leading ability, or if\r\nthere are no parameters and/or events to refer to, the relevant effects of the following ability fail.\r\n1.7.7c If an effect adds a connected ability pair (both the leading and following abilities) to an object,\r\nthey are connected on that object and the added following ability will only refer to the added leading\r\nability. If only one of the abilities is added, or both abilities are added by separate effects, then they\r\nare not connected on the object they are added to.\r\n1.7.8. The abilities of an object can be modified.\r\n1.7.9. The source of an ability is the card or token that has that ability. The source of abilities of an activated\u0002layer or triggered-layer is the same as the source of the ability that created that layer.\r\n1.7.9a Activated-layers and triggered-layers exist independently of their source. If the source of an\r\nactivated-layer or triggered-layer ceases to exist, it does not prevent the resolution of that layer.\r\n1.7.10. The controller of an activated-layer is the player who activated its source. The controller of a\r\ntriggered-layer is the player who controlled its source when it triggered - if the source has no controller,\r\nthe controller of the triggered-layer is player who owns the source.\r\n1.8. Effects\r\n1.8.1. An effect is generated by an ability or another effect, and can change the game state by producing\r\nevents or applying changes to objects or the game itself. When a layer resolves, a static ability becomes\r\nfunctional, a card/ability with an alternative/additional effect-cost is played/activated, or the conditions\r\nof another effect is met, it may generate an ordered sequence of one or more discrete and/or continuous\r\neffects.\r\n1.8.2. An optional effect is an effect that is not compulsory to generate or apply. An optional effect typically\r\ncontains the term “may”. When an optional effect would be generated, or would apply to objects or the\r\ngame, the player instructed by the effect chooses whether or not to generate or apply the effect.\r\n1.8.3. A conditional effect is an effect that is dependent on a condition to be met. A conditional effect is\r\ntypically written in the format “(If / During) [CONDITION], [EFFECT]”, where CONDITION is the\r\ncondition that must be met for EFFECT to be generated/applied.\r\nNote: Cards printed before 2022 have also used the format “If [EVENT and/or STATE]\r\n[ABILITIES]” to denote a triggered effect. (See Section 6.6 - Triggered Effects)\r\n1.8.3a A conditional effect, written in the format “Otherwise [Effect]”, is an effect that is conditional on\r\nthe opposite of a preceding conditional effect. This effect’s condition is met only when the\r\npreceding effect’s condition is not met.\r\n9\r\nCHAPTER 1. GAME CONCEPTS\r\nExample: Runeblood Incantation has the text “At the beginning of your action phase, remove\r\na verse counter from Runeblood Incantation. If you do, create a Runechant token. Otherwise,\r\ndestroy Runeblood Incantation.”, the latter part of which is a conditional discrete effect that is\r\nconditional on the failure to remove a verse counter from Runeblood Incantation.\r\n1.8.3b A conditional effect, written in the format “[EFFECT] unless [OPPCONDITION]”, is an effect\r\nthat is conditional on the opposite of the OPPCONDITION. This effect’s condition is only met when\r\nthe OPPCONDITION is not met, or the OPPCONDITION is an effect that fails (see Rule 1.8.8). If\r\nthe OPPCONDITION is an effect instead of a condition, it is an optional effect.\r\nNote: An effect that reads “Deal 2 damage to the attacking hero unless they pay {r}.” can\r\nbe read as “The attacking hero may pay {r}. If they don’t, deal 2 damage to them.”\r\nExample: Pitfall Trap has the text “Deal 2 damage to the attacking hero unless they pay {r}.”,\r\nwhich is a conditional discrete effect, that is conditional on the attacking hero not paying the\r\nasset-cost.\r\n1.8.3c A conditional effect, written in the format “[EFFECT] while [CONDITION]”, is an effect that\r\nonly applies as long as CONDITION is met. The CONDITION is evaluated at all times while the\r\neffect exists. If the effect applies to one or more subjects, CONDITION is evaluated per subject.\r\nExample: Parable of Humility has the text “Attack action cards controlled by an opposing hero\r\nhave -1{p} while attacking and defending.”, which is a conditional static-continuous effect that\r\napplies to more than one object and a condition that is checked per object that it applies to.\r\n1.8.4. A targeted effect is an effect where the target parameters are declared as the object, with the ability that\r\ngenerates it, is put onto the stack. Targeted effects always contain the phrase “target [DESCRIPTION]”\r\nor “[DESCRIPTION] (target/targets)” where DESCRIPTION is the specifics of one or more legal targets\r\nfor the effect.\r\n1.8.4a Only objects in the arena or on the stack are targetable (can be selected as a legal target), unless\r\nthe effect specifies the legal target as a zone or an object that does not exist in the arena or on the\r\nstack.\r\nExample: Memorial Ground (red) has the text “Put target attack action card with cost 2 or\r\nless from your graveyard on top of your deck.” which describes a legal target as a card in the\r\ngraveyard as opposed to a card in the arena or on the stack.\r\n1.8.4b The same legal target can not be declared more than once for any one instance of the target\r\nphrase.\r\n1.8.4c An effect that specifies one or more subjects to affect, but does not use the term “target”, is not a\r\ntargeted effect. Non-target subjects do not need to be declared until the effect is generated.\r\nExample: Remembrance has the text “Shuffle up to 3 action cards from your graveyard into\r\nyour deck.”, which is not a targeted effect because it does not use the term “target” before the\r\nspecified subjects of the effect.\r\n1.8.4d If the DESCRIPTION of a legal target is “any”, then the legal targets are dependent on the\r\napplication of the effect. In this context, a legal target is any target that does not cause the effect to\r\nfail for the current game state.\r\n1.8.4e If a targeted effect is optional, the player(s) instructed are not required to select a target. If a\r\nplayer does not select a target, the optional effect is not generated.\r\n10\r\nCHAPTER 1. GAME CONCEPTS\r\n1.8.5. If the parameters of an effect are undetermined at the time the effect is generated, the player instructed\r\nby the effect determines the parameters of the effect. If no legal parameters exist, then any part of the\r\neffect related to those parameters fails.\r\nExample: Remembrance has the text “Shuffle up to 3 action cards from your graveyard into your\r\ndeck.”. This effect does not require targets when Remembrance is played on the stack, so when the\r\neffect is generated upon resolution, up to three action cards must be determined by the controlling\r\nplayer.\r\n1.8.5a If two or more players are instructed to determine the parameters of an effect, those players\r\ndetermine the parameters in clockwise order, starting with the turn player. (See Rule 1.1.6)\r\n1.8.5b If the parameters of an effect include determining an object, the player can only determine\r\nobjects that are public as parameters for the effect. (See Rule 3.0.3)\r\nExample: Oasis Respite has the text “Prevent the next 4 damage that would be dealt to target\r\nhero this turn by a source of your choice.”, which has a parameter that must be a public object.\r\n1.8.6. If an effect refers to the value of a property, it infers the existence of the property as well as its value.\r\nIf an object does not have that property, it does not meet the condition of the existence of the property\r\nand thus the condition of the value of the property.\r\nExample: Harmonized Kodachi has the text “While you have a card in your pitch zone with cost 0,\r\n[...]”, which can be interpreted as “While you have a card in your pitch zone with the cost property\r\nand the value of that property is 0, [...]”. This means a card without the cost property, such as\r\nHeart of Fyendal, will not satisfy the condition if it is in the pitch zone.\r\nExample: Find Center has the text “Find Center can’t be defended by cards with cost less than the\r\nnumber of chain links you control, [...]”, which can be interpreted as “Find Center can not be\r\ndefended by cards with the cost property, if the value of the cost property is less than the number of\r\nchain links you control, [...]”. This means cards without the cost property, such as Ironrot Helm,\r\nwould be able to defend the attack.\r\nExample: Mutated Mass has the text “Mutated Mass’s {p} and {d} are equal to twice the number\r\nof cards in your pitch zone with different costs.”, which can be interpreted as “Mutated Mass’s {p}\r\nand {d} is equal to twice the number of cards in your pitch zone with the cost property, that have\r\ndifferent costs.”. This means cards without the cost property, such as Heart of Fyendal, will not\r\nsatisfy the condition (and be included in the calculation) if it is in the pitch zone.\r\n1.8.6a If an effect requires the value of a numeric property from a specific object without that property,\r\nthen zero is used as the value for the purpose of the effect.\r\nExample: Ravenous Rabble has the text “Reveal the top card of your deck. Ravenous Rabble\r\ngets -X{p}, where X is the pitch value of the card revealed this way.”. If the revealed card for\r\nthis effect was Gorganian Tome, which does not have the pitch property, the value of X would\r\nbe zero.\r\n1.8.7. If an effect instructs that a player may do something as though a condition were true, the condition is\r\nconsidered met for the purposes of the applicable effect only.\r\n1.8.8. An effect fails if the target(s) of the effect cease to exist, if there are no legal parameters at the time the\r\neffect is generated, or if the events it creates fail to occur.\r\n11\r\nCHAPTER 1. GAME CONCEPTS\r\n1.8.9. The source of an effect is the same as the source of the ability or effect that generated it, unless\r\notherwise specified by the effect.\r\nExample: Electrify has the text “The next time an attack action card hits a hero this turn, it deals 3\r\ndamage to them.”, which is a delayed-triggered effect that triggers to deal damage, specifying the\r\nsource of the damage effect as the attack action card that caused the effect to trigger.\r\n1.8.10. The controller of an effect is the same as the controller of the ability or effect that generated it, unless\r\notherwise specified by the effect.\r\n1.9. Events\r\n1.9.1. An event is a change in the game state produced by the resolution of a layer, the result of an effect, a\r\ntransition of turn phase or combat step, or an action taken by a player. An event may involve physically\r\nchanging the game state through one or more instructions - it can be modified by replacement effects\r\n(see Section 6.4 - Replacement Effects) and can trigger triggered effects (see Section 6.6 - Triggered\r\nEffects).\r\n1.9.1a If an event involves instructions that are performed on elements outside the game, that event can\r\nnot be modified by replacement effects or trigger triggered effects within the game, unless the event\r\ndirectly interacts with the game.\r\nExample: Go Bananas has the text “Open and reveal a booster pack of Flesh and Blood and\r\nput all cards with the chosen name into your hand.”, which creates a ‘reveal’ event and a ‘put’\r\nevent as part of its resolution. The ‘reveal’ event only operates outside of the game, so any\r\nreplacement effects and triggered effects within the game do not interact with it. The ‘put’\r\nevent directly interacts with the game by putting an object into a game zone, so replacement\r\neffects and triggered effects within the game may interact with it.\r\n1.9.2. A compound event is an event that involves performing the same instructions more than once. An\r\neffect that produces a compound event is typically written in a compact format, where the effect\r\nspecifies to repeat an instruction a number of times. When a compound event occurs, it is expanded, and\r\nthe instructions occur as individual events.\r\nExample: Tome of Harvests has the text “Draw 3 cards.”, which is an effect written in compact\r\nform, that produces a compound event that involves drawing a card three times. Each draw is\r\nperformed as an individual event: draw a card, draw a card, draw a card.\r\n1.9.2a If a triggered effect triggers from a compound event, it does not trigger again for any of the\r\nindividual events of that compound event.\r\nExample: Korshem, Crossroads of the Elements, has the text “Whenever a hero reveals 1 or\r\nmore cards, [...]”, which is a triggered effect that triggers on the compound event of revealing\r\none or more cards, but does not then trigger on any of the individual events from that\r\ncompound event.\r\n1.9.2b If a replacement effect replaces a compound event, it can not replace any of the individual events\r\nof that compound event.\r\n12\r\nCHAPTER 1. GAME CONCEPTS\r\nExample: Mordred Tide has the text “Until end of turn, if you would create a Runechant token,\r\ninstead create that many plus 1.”, which replaces the compound event that creates X\r\nRunechant tokens with a compound event that creates X + 1 Runechant tokens. It does not\r\nthen replace each of the X + 1 individual “create a Runechant token” event with “create 2\r\nRunechant tokens”.\r\n1.9.2c If an event involves two or more players performing an instruction, it is a compound event where\r\neach player performs that instruction in clockwise order as an individual event, starting with the turn\r\nplayer. (See Rule 1.1.6)\r\nExample: This Round’s on Me has the text “Each hero draws a card.”, which when resolved\r\nproduces a compound event that instructs each hero to draw a card. When this compound event\r\noccurs, the turn player draws a card first, followed by each player in turn order.\r\n1.9.3. A composite event is an event that is made up of one or more internal events. An effect that produces a\r\ncomposite event typically uses an effect keyword. (See Section 8.5 - Effect Keywords)\r\nExample: Discard is a composite event that involves moving a card from a player’s hand to their\r\ngraveyard.\r\n1.9.3a If a composite event occurs, and the composite event and/or internal event(s) would trigger the\r\ntriggered effect, the triggered effect only triggers once on the composite event.\r\n1.9.3b If a rule or effect prevents a triggered effect from triggering on a composite event and/or its\r\ninternal event(s), then the triggered effect does not trigger on the composite event.\r\n1.9.3c Replacement effects that partially modify internal events, do not modify the composite event that\r\ncontains it, and therefore the composite event still occurs.\r\nExample: Discard is a composite event that involves moving a card from the hand to the\r\ngraveyard. If a replacement effect replaces the destination of the move event, then the discard\r\nevent is still considered to occur.\r\n1.9.3d If no internal events of a composite event occur, then the composite event is considered not to\r\nhave occurred, and triggered effects that trigger on the composite event and/or internal event(s) do\r\nnot trigger.\r\nExample: Discard is a composite event that involves moving a card from the hand to the\r\ngraveyard. If a replacement effect replaces the move event entirely, then the discard event is\r\nconsidered not to occur and abilities that trigger on discard are not triggered.\r\n1.10. Game State\r\n1.10.1. A game state is a moment in the game. The game transitions between states when players make\r\nactions or decisions, or when game state processes occur.\r\n1.10.2. When the game transitions to a new game state, the following game state actions are performed first:\r\n1.10.2a First, if one or more heroes have died, their player loses the game (or the game ends in a draw).\r\n(See Section 4.5 - Ending a Game)\r\n1.10.2b Second, if one or more living objects in the arena have 0 life total, they are cleared\r\nsimultaneously as a single event. Living objects that cease to exist are considered to have died. (See\r\nRule 2.5.1 and Rule 3.0.12)\r\n13\r\nCHAPTER 1. GAME CONCEPTS\r\n1.10.2c Third and finally, if a triggered-layer has been created it is added to the stack. If two or more\r\ntriggered-layers have been created, they are added to the stack in an order chosen by the turn player.\r\n1.10.3. If a player makes an illegal action, or starts to make an action that becomes illegal to complete, the\r\ngame state is reversed to the legal state before that action started.\r\n1.10.3a Triggered effects do not trigger as a result of the action being reversed.\r\n1.10.3b Replacement effects can not replace any event as a result of the action being reversed.\r\n1.10.3c If the game state can not be reversed, as much as possible about the state is reversed and the\r\ngame continues as though it were the last legal state before the reversal.\r\n1.11. Priority\r\n1.11.1. Priority is a game state concept that describes which player (if any), may play a card, activate an\r\nability, or pass priority to the next player.\r\n1.11.2. Only one player can have priority at any point in time. A player who has priority is the “active\r\nplayer”. A player who does not have priority is an “inactive player”.\r\n1.11.3. The Action Phase is the only phase when players get priority. Within the action phase, players do not\r\nget priority during the Damage Step or Close Step of combat. At the beginning of the action phase,\r\nduring most steps of combat, and after the resolution of a layer, the turn player gains priority. (See\r\nSection 4.2 - Start Phase, Chapter 7 - Combat, and Section 5.3 - Resolution Abilities & Resolving\r\nLayers)\r\n1.11.4. The active player may pass priority to the next player, referred to as “pass”.\r\n1.11.4a If a player passes, priority is given to the next player in clockwise order (see Rule 1.1.6).\r\nTypically, if all players pass in succession without playing any cards or activating any abilities, and\r\nthe stack is not empty, the top layer of the stack resolves (see Section 5.3 - Resolution Abilities &\r\nResolving Layers) - otherwise if the stack is empty, the phase or step ends (see Chapter 4 - Game\r\nStructure and Chapter 7 - Combat).\r\n1.11.5. If the active player plays a card or activates an ability, they regain priority after the card has been\r\nplayed or the ability has been activated (see Rule 5.1.10). If the active player passes, they lose priority\r\nuntil they receive it again from a rule. No player has priority while playing a card, activating an ability,\r\nresolving a layer, during a game process, and/or during game state actions.\r\n1.12. Numbers and Symbols\r\n1.12.1. Numbers are always integers.\r\n1.12.1a If a rule or effect would calculate a fractional number and does not specify to round up or down,\r\nthe number is rounded towards zero.\r\nExample: An effect that would calculate the number 3.5 would be rounded down to 3, but the\r\nnumber -3.5 would be rounded up to -3.\r\n1.12.1b If a rule or effect requires a player to choose a number, the number selected must be a\r\nnon-negative integer - zero and above. If it requires the player to choose “up to” a number, the\r\nnumber selected must be between zero and the specified number, inclusive.\r\n14\r\nCHAPTER 1. GAME CONCEPTS\r\n1.12.2. The letter X is used to represent a value that starts undefined and is defined later by a rule or effect.\r\n1.12.2a If an object has a property with the value X, and the value of X undefined, the object is still\r\nconsidered to have that property and the value of X is evaluated to be zero.\r\n1.12.2b If an object has a property with the value X, and the value of X is defined, it remains defined\r\nuntil the object ceases to exist.\r\n1.12.2c If there are two or more undefined values in the same context, the letters Y and Z may also be\r\nused to represent those undefined values.\r\n1.12.3. The asterisk symbol (*) is used to represent a value that is defined by a meta-static ability.\r\n1.12.3a If an object has a property with the value (*) and the property-static ability can not be used to\r\ndefine the value, the object is still considered to have that property and the value of (*) is evaluated\r\nto be zero.\r\nExample: Mutated Mass has an ability that defines its power and defense as double the total\r\nnumber of distinct costs of cards in the pitch zone. Outside of a game, this ability can not be\r\nused to define the power and defense, so they are instead evaluated to be zero.\r\n1.12.3b If an object has a property with the value (*) and the ability can be used to define the value, then\r\n(*) is evaluated according to the ability.\r\n1.12.4. Symbols are typically used to represent the value of specified properties. (See Chapter 2 - Object\r\nProperties)\r\n1.12.4a The defense symbol is {d} and represents a defense value.\r\n1.12.4b The intellect symbol is {i} and represents an intellect value.\r\n1.12.4c The life symbol is {h} and represents a life value.\r\n1.12.4d The power symbol is {p} and represents a power value. It is also used to refer to physical\r\ndamage (see Rule 8.5.3e).\r\n1.12.4e The resource symbol is {r} and represents a resource value.\r\n1.13. Assets\r\n1.13.1. An asset is a point of a given type, owned by a player. There are two types of assets: action points\r\nand resource points.\r\n1.13.2. An action point is an asset that is typically used to play an action card and/or activate an action\r\nability.\r\n1.13.2a The turn player can gain action points from the following: at the start of their action phase (see\r\nSection 4.3 - Action Phase), the ability go again (see Rule 8.3.5), and effects that grant the player\r\naction points.\r\n1.13.2b A non-turn player can not gain action points. If a non-turn player would gain an action point\r\nfrom a rule or effect, they instead do not gain any action points.\r\n15\r\nCHAPTER 1. GAME CONCEPTS\r\nExample: Lead the Charge has the text “The next time you play an action card with cost 0 or\r\ngreater this turn, gain 1 action point. Go again”. If a non-turn player played (as an instant)\r\nLead the Charge (red), they would not gain an action point from the ability “go again”. If they\r\nthen played an action card with cost 0 (as an instant), they would not gain an action point from\r\nthe delayed-triggered effect of Lead the Charge.\r\n1.13.3. A resource point is an asset that is typically used to play cards and activate abilities.\r\n1.13.3a A player can gain resource points from the following: pitching cards during the payment of an\r\nasset-cost that requires resource points (see Rule 1.14.3), and effects that grant the player resource\r\npoints.\r\n1.14. Costs\r\n1.14.1. A cost is the requirement of payment from a player incurred by playing a card, activating an ability,\r\nor resolving/applying an effect. A cost requires the payment of assets (asset-costs) and/or the successful\r\nresolution of effects (effect-costs).\r\n1.14.2. An asset-cost is a cost that requires the payment of one or more assets (see Section 1.13 - Assets).\r\nTo pay an asset-cost as a player, the player must have or gain assets of the appropriate type equal to, or\r\ngreater than, the cost to be paid; then those the asset-cost amounts are subtracted from the player’s assets\r\nand the cost is considered paid.\r\n1.14.2a If a player must pay a resource cost less than or equal to the number of resource points they\r\nhave, that player must use those resource points to pay the resource cost. If not, then the player may\r\npitch cards one at a time until they have enough resource points to pay the cost. (See Rule 1.14.3)\r\nExample: A player has 1 resource point and plays a card with 3 cost (more than the number of\r\nresources they have). If the player pitches a 3-pitch card, generating 3 resources, they have\r\nfinished paying the asset-cost of the card, have 1 resource point left over, and can no longer\r\npitch cards because there are no more costs to pay. If the player pitches a 1-pitch card,\r\ngenerating 1 resource, they still have 1 resource left to pay and must continue pitching cards\r\nuntil the asset-cost is paid.\r\n1.14.2b If an asset-cost involves paying two or more types of assets, the player declares the order in\r\nwhich the costs will be paid before any cost is paid.\r\n1.14.2c If a player does not have enough assets and can not generate any additional assets to pay an\r\nasset-cost, the cost can not be paid and the game state is reversed to before the cost is paid. If the\r\nasset-cost is mandatory and part of another action, the entire action is reversed. (See Section 1.10.3 -\r\nGame State).\r\n1.14.3. To pitch a card as a player, the player moves the card from their hand to the pitch zone and generates\r\nresource points equal to the pitch value of the card pitched.\r\n1.14.3a A card can not be pitched if it does not have the pitch property. (See Section 2.7 - Pitch)\r\n1.14.3b A card can not be pitched this way if there is no resource cost to pay, or if the player has\r\nresource points equal to or greater than the resource cost to be paid.\r\n1.14.3c Pitching a card is an event that can trigger and be replaced by effects.\r\n16\r\nCHAPTER 1. GAME CONCEPTS\r\n1.14.4. An effect-cost is a cost that requires payment in the form of generating one or more effects. To pay an\r\neffect-cost, the player must be able to successfully generate and resolve the specified costs.\r\nExample: Hope Merchant’s Hood has the text “Instant – Destroy Hope Merchant’s Hood: Shuffle\r\nany number of cards from your hand into your deck, then draw that many cards.”, which is an\r\nactivated ability with an effect-cost of destroying Hope Merchant’s Hood.\r\n1.14.4a If an effect-cost involves generating two or more effects, the player declares the order in which\r\nthe effects will be generated.\r\n1.14.4b Before the effect-cost is paid, if any of the effects can not be generated due to a rule or effect,\r\nor the effects can not resolve successfully based on the current game state, the cost can not be paid\r\nand the game state is reversed to before the cost is paid. If the effect-cost is mandatory and part of\r\nanother action, the entire action is reversed. (See Section 1.10.3 - Game State).\r\n1.14.4c During the payment of an effect-cost, if the events of any effects are replaced and can not be\r\nsuccessfully resolved, the cost is still considered paid.\r\n1.14.5. A cost that is represented by “0”, or a cost in which all asset-costs are reduced to zero and there are\r\nno effect-costs, is still considered a cost which is paid by acknowledging the zero cost.\r\n1.15. Counters\r\n1.15.1. A counter is a physical marker placed on any public object (see Rule 3.0.3). A counter is not an\r\nobject and does not have properties. The identity of a counter is defined by its name, or its numerical\r\nvalue and symbol. Counters with the same name, or value and symbol, are functionally identical and\r\ninterchangeable.\r\n1.15.2. When a counter is on an object, it modifies its properties and/or interacts with effects.\r\n1.15.2a A counter with a numerical value and symbol that corresponds to an object property modifies\r\nthat property of the object it is on. This modification is considered a rule, not an effect, but does take\r\nplace at the same time as continuous effects that modify the object in the same way. (See Rule 6.3.2\r\nand Rule 6.3.3)\r\n1.15.3. When an object ceases to exist, the counters on that object cease to exist (see Rule 3.0.9). When a\r\ncounter is removed from an object it ceases to exist.\r\n1.15.4. If a counter would be added to an object that has a diametrically opposing counter on it, both\r\ndiametrically opposing counters remain on the object.\r\nExample: If a -1{p} counter is placed on an object with a +1{p} counter on it, they both remain\r\non the object. The counters do not cancel each other out and they are not removed from the object\r\nsimply because they are diametrically opposing.\r\n17\r\n2. Object Properties\r\n2.0. General\r\n2.0.1. A property is an attribute of an object that defines how the object interacts with the rules and effects of\r\nthe game. There are 13 properties an object may have: abilities (see Section 1.7 - Abilities), color strip,\r\ncost, defense, intellect, life, name, pitch, power, subtypes, supertypes, text box, and type.\r\n2.0.1a An ability is a property, not an object. However, activated abilities have the object properties cost\r\nand type, for the purposes of rules and effects.\r\n2.0.2. The properties of a card are defined by the information printed on the official Flesh and Blood card.\r\nIf a property is not printed on the official Flesh and Blood card, the card it represents does not have that\r\nproperty.\r\n2.0.2a If an errata has been published for a given card, the properties of that card are defined by the\r\ncorrections in that errata. (See http://fabtcg.com/errata)\r\n2.0.3. A numeric property is a property that has a numeric value. The value of some numeric properties can\r\nbe modified by effects and/or counters to produce a modified value. The copyable value of the numeric\r\nproperty is typically the value that the object starts its existence with.\r\n2.0.3a An effect that modifies the value of a numeric property does not modify the base value of that\r\nproperty unless otherwise specified by the effect.\r\nExample: An effect that specifies an object to “gain”, “get”, “have”, or “lose” a\r\nproperty-related value, modifies the value of the property but does not change the base value\r\nunless it specifically uses the term “base”.\r\n2.0.3b A numeric property is considered to have increased or decreased if a rule or effect is applied that\r\ncauses an increase or decrease to its base or modified value (see Rule 6.2.5).\r\nExample: Korshem, Crossroads of the Elements has the text “[...], if [...] no card or token\r\ncontrolled by a hero has had {p} or {d} increased this turn, destroy Korshem, Crossroads of\r\nthe Elements.”. If a player plays a card and an effect applies to the card that increases its\r\npower, a card controlled by a hero has had its power increased and Korshem will not be\r\ndestroyed.\r\n2.0.3c A numeric property can not have a negative base or modified value. If one or more effects would\r\nset or reduce the base or modified value of a numeric property to be less than zero, instead they set\r\nor reduce it to zero.\r\n2.0.3d A +1 or −1 property-related counter on an object, modifies the value of the property but does\r\nnot change the base value.\r\n2.0.4. An object is considered to have gained a property, or part of a property, if it did not have that\r\nproperty/part before, but currently does. An object is considered to have lost a property, or part of a\r\nproperty, if it had that property/part but currently does not.\r\n2.0.5. The source of a property is the object that the property is an attribute of.\r\n18\r\nCHAPTER 2. OBJECT PROPERTIES\r\n2.1. Color Strip\r\n2.1.1. Color Strip is a visual representation of the printed pitch of a card.\r\n2.1.2. The color strip of a card is typically located at the top of a card. The printed pitch of a card determines\r\nthe color strip of the card. Cards with a printed pitch of 1, 2, and 3, typically have a color strip of red,\r\nyellow, and blue respectively. A card with no printed pitch typically does not have a color strip.\r\n• A card with a red color strip is considered red for the purposes of rules and effects.\r\n• A card with a yellow color strip is considered yellow for the purposes of rules and effects.\r\n• A card with a blue color strip is considered blue for the purposes of rules and effects.\r\n2.1.3. If the base pitch or pitch of a card is modified, it does not modify the color strip of the card.\r\n2.2. Cost\r\n2.2.1. Cost is a numeric property of a card or ability, which determines the starting resource asset-cost to play\r\nthe card or activate the ability. (See Rule 5.1.6)\r\n2.2.2. The printed cost of a card is typically expressed within a resource point symbol located in the top right\r\ncorner of the card. The printed cost defines the base cost of a card. If a card does not have a printed cost,\r\nit does not have the cost property (0 is a valid printed cost).\r\n2.2.2a If the printed value is expressed as two or more undefined symbols and/or numeric values, they\r\nare additive for determining the base cost of a card.\r\nExample: Spark of Genius has the cost property with the printed value of “XX”, which\r\ndetermines the base cost as X + X for any value of X.\r\n2.2.3. The printed cost of an activated ability is expressed as {r} symbols as part of the description of the\r\nability, where the number of {r} symbols dictates the printed cost. If there are no resource symbols, then\r\nthe printed cost is 0. The printed cost defines the base resource cost of the ability. (See Rule 5.2.1)\r\n2.2.4. The cost property of an object cannot be modified.\r\n2.2.4a An effect that increases or reduces the cost of an object does not modify the cost property of that\r\nobject. Effects that modify cost are only applied as part of the process for playing or activating that\r\nobject. (See Rule 5.1.6)\r\nExample: An effect that reduces the cost to play a card does not change the cost property of\r\nthat card in any way - it only changes the calculation of the resource cost when that card is\r\nbeing played.\r\n2.2.4b An effect that refers to the cost of an object refers to the unmodified cost property of an object.\r\nAn effect that refers to the payment of an object, refers to the modified cost of an object when it was\r\npaid to play/activate and put that object on the stack.\r\n2.2.5. The visual expression in {r} symbols and the numerical expression of cost are functionally identical.\r\nExample: The text “Search your deck for a card with cost value 1”, is considered to be the same as\r\nthe text “Search your deck for a card with cost value {r}.”\r\n19\r\nCHAPTER 2. OBJECT PROPERTIES\r\n2.3. Defense\r\n2.3.1. Defense is a numeric property of an object, which represents the value contributed to the total sum of\r\ndefense used in the damage step of combat. (See Section 7.5 - Damage Step)\r\n2.3.2. The printed defense of a card is typically located at the bottom right corner of a card next to the {d}\r\nsymbol. The printed defense defines the base defense of a card. If a card does not have a printed defense,\r\nit does not have the defense property (0 is a valid printed defense).\r\n2.3.2a If the defense of a card is represented as a (*), then the card has an ability that defines the defense\r\nof the card at any point in or out of the game. If the ability requires a number that can not be\r\ndetermined, the defense of the card is 0.\r\n2.3.3. The defense of an object can be modified. The term “defense” or the symbol {d} refers to the\r\nmodified defense of an object.\r\n2.4. Intellect\r\n2.4.1. Intellect is a numeric property of a hero card, which represents the number of cards the controlling\r\nplayer draws up to at the end of their turn. (See Section 4.4 - End Phase)\r\n2.4.2. The printed intellect of a card is typically located at the bottom left corner of a card next to the {i}\r\nsymbol. The printed intellect defines the base intellect of a card. If a card does not have a printed\r\nintellect, it does not have the intellect property (0 is a valid printed intellect).\r\n2.4.3. The intellect of an object can be modified. The term “intellect” or the symbol {i} refers to the\r\nmodified intellect of an object.\r\n2.5. Life\r\n2.5.1. Life is a numeric property of an object, which represents the starting life total of that object. An object\r\nwith the life property is a living object.\r\n2.5.2. The printed life of a card is typically located at the bottom right corner of a card next to the {h}\r\nsymbol. The printed life defines the base life of a card. If a card does not have a printed life, it does not\r\nhave the life property (0 is a valid printed life).\r\n2.5.3. The life of an object can be modified. The term “life total” or the symbol {h} refers to the modified\r\nlife of an object.\r\n2.5.3a An object’s life total is equal to the object’s base life, plus life gained and minus life lost, as\r\nrecorded by the players of the game.\r\n2.5.3b Life gained and life lost are not continuous effects - they are discrete effects that apply once, and\r\nthey permanently modify the life total. (See Rule 8.5.8)\r\n2.5.3c If the base life of an object changes, then the life total is recalculated using the new base life\r\nvalue of the object.\r\nExample: Shiyana has 20 base life and the text “[...] Shiyana becomes a copy of target hero\r\n[...]”. If Shiyana has lost 5 life and copies the target hero is Kano, with 15 base life, the new\r\nlife total for Shiyana is 10.\r\n20\r\nCHAPTER 2. OBJECT PROPERTIES\r\n2.5.3d An object’s life total can be greater than its base life.\r\n2.5.3e An object can not have a negative life total. If life loss would reduce an object’s life total to less\r\nthan zero, instead it reduces it to zero.\r\n2.5.3f If a living object’s life total is reduced to zero, it is cleared as a game state action; or if the living\r\nobject is a hero, their player loses or the game is a draw as a game state action. (See Rule 1.10.2 and\r\nSection 4.5 - Ending a Game)\r\n2.5.3g If a living object ceases to exist, it is considered to have died.\r\n2.6. Name\r\n2.6.1. Name is a property of an object, which represents one of its object identities and determines the\r\nobject’s uniqueness (along with the pitch property). (See Rule 1.2.4 and Rule 1.3.2)\r\n2.6.2. The printed name of a card is typically located at the top of the card. The printed name defines the\r\nname of a card.\r\n2.6.3. If an object has a name that is a personal name, that name determines the object’s moniker - the most\r\nsignificant identifier of the object’s name. A personal name is typically written in the format\r\n“[HONORIFIC?] [MONIKER] [LAST?] [, SUFFIX?]”, where HONORIFIC (if any) is one or more\r\nname honorifics, MONIKER is the moniker of the name, LAST (if any) is one or more middle and/or\r\nlast names, and SUFFIX (if any) is a title or nickname written after a comma.\r\nExample: The monikers of these names are as follows: Bravo (Bravo), Dorinthea Ironsong\r\n(Dorinthea), Data Doll MKII (Data Doll), Ser Boltyn, Breaker of Dawn (Boltyn), Blasmophet, the\r\nSoul Harvester, (Blasmophet), The Librarian (The Librarian), Dawnblade (Dawnblade),\r\nStalagmite, Bastion of Isenloft (Stalagmite).\r\n2.6.3a If an object does not have a name that is a personal name, it does not have a moniker.\r\n2.6.3b If two objects have different names, they may have the same moniker. An effect that refers to an\r\nobject using a moniker may refer to two or more objects with different names but the same moniker.\r\nExample: The cards “Bravo”, “Bravo, Showstopper”, and “Bravo, Star of the Show”, all\r\nhave the moniker “Bravo”.\r\n2.6.3c A moniker is not considered a name. If an effect identifies an object by a name, it does not\r\nidentify objects with a moniker that is the same as that name.\r\nExample: If a player is instructed by an effect to name a card and they declare “Dawnblade”,\r\nthe effect identifies cards with the name “Dawnblade”, but not cards with the name\r\n“Dawnblade, Resplendent” despite them having the moniker “Dawnblade”.\r\n2.6.4. An object’s printed name is always considered to be the English language version of its name,\r\nregardless of the printed language.\r\n2.6.5. A name or part of a name is equal to another name or part of a name only if it is an exact\r\ncase-insensitive match.\r\n21\r\nCHAPTER 2. OBJECT PROPERTIES\r\nExample: Knick Knack Bric-a-brac has the text “Search your deck for a card with Amulet, Potion,\r\nor Talisman in its name, put it into the arena, then shuffle.”, which identifies an object when there is\r\nan exact match between “potion” and part of the object’s name. An object with the hypothetical\r\nname “Spot Ionizer” would not be identified.\r\n2.7. Pitch\r\n2.7.1. Pitch is a numeric property of a card, which represents the number of resources the card generates\r\nwhen it is pitched and determines the object’s uniqueness (along with the name property). (See Rule\r\n1.14.2a and Rule 1.3.2)\r\n2.7.2. The printed pitch of a card is expressed visually as one, two, or three socketed {r} symbols, typically\r\nlocated in the top left corner of a card, where the number of {r} symbols dictates the printed pitch. The\r\nprinted pitch defines the base pitch of a card. If a card does not have a printed pitch, it does not have the\r\npitch property.\r\n2.7.3. The pitch of an object can be modified. The term “pitch” refers to the modified pitch of an object.\r\n2.7.4. The visual expression in {r} symbols and the numerical expression of pitch are functionally identical.\r\nExample: The text “Search your deck for a card with pitch value 1”, is considered to be the same\r\nas the text “Search your deck for a card with pitch value {r}.”\r\n2.8. Power\r\n2.8.1. Power is a numeric property of an object, which represents the power value used in the damage step of\r\ncombat. (See Section 7.5 - Damage Step)\r\n2.8.2. The printed power of a card is typically located at the bottom left corner of a card next to the {p}\r\nsymbol. The printed power defines the base power of a card. If a card does not have a printed power, it\r\ndoes not have the power property (0 is a valid printed power).\r\n2.8.2a If the power value of a card is represented as a (*) then the card has an ability that defines the\r\nbase power of the card at any point in or out of the game. If the ability requires a number that can\r\nnot be determined, the power of the card is 0.\r\n2.8.3. The power of an object can be modified. The term “power” or the symbol {p} refers to the modified\r\npower of an object.\r\n2.9. Subtypes\r\n2.9.1. Subtypes are a collection of subtype keywords.\r\n2.9.2. An object can have zero or more subtypes.\r\n2.9.3. The subtypes of a card are determined by its type box. Subtypes (if any) are printed after a long dash\r\nafter the card’s type.\r\n2.9.4. The subtypes of an activated-layer or triggered-layer are the same as the subtypes of its source.\r\n2.9.5. An object can gain or lose subtypes from rules and/or effects.\r\n22\r\nCHAPTER 2. OBJECT PROPERTIES\r\n2.9.6. Subtypes are either functional or non-functional keywords. Functional subtypes add additional rules to\r\nan object. Non-functional subtypes do not add additional rules to an object.\r\n2.9.6a The functional subtype keywords are (1H), (2H), Affliction, Ally, Arrow, Ash, Attack, Aura,\r\nConstruct, Invocation, Item, Landmark, and Quiver. (See Section 8.2 - Subtype Keywords)\r\n2.9.6b The non-functional subtypes keywords are Arms, Axe, Book, Bow, Chest, Claw, Club, Dagger,\r\nDemon, Dragon, Flail, Gem, Gun, Hammer, Head, Legs, Lute, Off-hand, Orb, Pistol, Rock, Scepter,\r\nScythe, Shuriken, Staff, Sword, Trap, and Young.\r\n2.10. Supertypes\r\n2.10.1. Supertypes are a collection of supertype keywords.\r\n2.10.2. An object can have zero or more supertypes.\r\n2.10.3. The supertypes of a card are determined by its type box. Supertypes are printed before the card’s\r\ntype.\r\n2.10.4. The supertypes of an activated-layer or triggered-layer are the same as the supertypes of its source.\r\n2.10.5. An object can gain or lose supertypes from rules and/or effects.\r\n2.10.6. Supertypes are non-functional keywords and do not add additional rules to an object. A supertype is\r\neither a class or a talent.\r\n2.10.6a The class supertype keywords are Adjudicator, Assassin, Bard, Brute, Guardian, Illusionist,\r\nMechanologist, Merchant, Ninja, Ranger, Runeblade, Shapeshifter, Warrior, and Wizard.\r\n2.10.6b The talent supertype keywords are Draconic, Earth, Elemental, Ice, Light, Lightning, Royal,\r\nand Shadow.\r\n2.11. Text Box\r\n2.11.1. The text box of a card contains the card text of a card, typically located on the lower half of a card\r\nbeneath the illustration.\r\n2.11.2. The card text of a card contains the rules text, reminder text, and flavor text of the card (if any). Rules\r\ntext is printed in roman and boldface. Reminder text is printed in parenthesized italics. Flavor text is\r\nseparated vertically from the rules and reminder text (if any) by a horizontal bar and is printed in italics.\r\n2.11.3. The rules text of a card defines the base abilities of the card. A paragraph of rules text typically\r\ndefines a single ability. Reminder and flavor text do not affect the game.\r\n2.11.4. The rules text of a card is always considered to be the official rules text on the most recent English\r\nprinted version of a card unless a card has received errata. If a card has received a functional errata, it\r\nwill be announced in this document or in an errata bulletin at http://fabtcg.com/errata. The official card\r\ntext will be updated to match the errata.\r\n2.11.5. If the rules text specifies the name and/or moniker of its source object in the third-person it is a self\u0002reference. A self-reference can be interpreted as “this” and it refers to its source object and not other\r\ncards with the same name.\r\n23\r\nCHAPTER 2. OBJECT PROPERTIES\r\n2.11.5a If an ability is otherwise gained by an object, and the rules text that defines that ability includes\r\nreferences to its source object by name/moniker, the gained ability refers to its current source.\r\nExample: Fractal Replication has the text “When you play or defend with Fractal Replication,\r\nit gains the base abilities of all Illusionist attack action cards on the combat chain.”. If Fractal\r\nReplication gains the ability “If Wartune Herald hits, put it into your hero’s soul.” from a card\r\ncalled Wartune Herald, the gained ability now refers to Fractal Replication and can be read as\r\n“If Fractal Replication hits, put it into your hero’s soul.”\r\n2.11.6. If the rules text specifies the name of another object in the context of creating it, it refers to a\r\nhypothetical object with defined properties, including that name (see Section 1.4 - Tokens). Otherwise, if\r\nthe rules text specifies the name and/or moniker of another object it refers to any existing object with\r\nthat name and/or moniker.\r\n2.12. Type Box\r\n2.12.1. The type box of a card determines the card’s type, supertype(s) (if any), and subtype(s) (if any),\r\ntypically located at the bottom of the card. Type boxes are typically written in the format\r\n“[SUPERTYPES] [TYPE] [— SUBTYPES?]”, where SUPERTYPES is one or more supertypes, TYPE\r\nis a type (if any), and SUBTYPES (if any) is one or more subtypes.\r\n2.12.1a If the SUPERTYPES of a type box is “Generic”, the card has no supertypes.\r\n2.12.1b Hybrid cards are cards with SUPERTYPES written in the format “[SUPERTYPES-1] /\r\n[SUPERTYPES-2]”. A hybrid card can be included in a player’s card-pool as though it only has one\r\nof the supertypes sets, SUPERTYPES-1 or SUPERTYPES-2, not both (see Rule 1.1.3). Otherwise,\r\nhybrid cards have all of the supertypes specified by SUPERTYPES-1 and SUPERTYPES-2.\r\n2.13. Types\r\n2.13.1. Types are a collection of type keywords.\r\n2.13.2. An object can have zero or more types.\r\n2.13.3. The type of a card is determined by its type box. The type is printed after the card’s supertypes, and\r\nbefore a long dash and subtypes (if any).\r\n2.13.4. The types of an activated-layer or triggered-layer are the same as the types of its source.\r\n2.13.4a The types of an activated ability layer include the types determined by the activated ability. (See\r\nRule 5.2.1)\r\n2.13.5. An object can gain or lose types from rules and/or effects.\r\n2.13.6. Types are functional keywords and add additional rules to an object.\r\n2.13.6a The type keywords are Action, Attack Reaction, Defense Reaction, Equipment, Hero, Instant,\r\nMentor, Resource, and Weapon. (See Section 8.1 - Type Keywords)\r\n24\r\n3. Zones\r\n3.0. General\r\n3.0.1. A zone is a collection of objects and has a physical position in the play-space. There are 15 types of\r\nzones: arms, arsenal, banished, chest, combat chain, deck, graveyard, hand, head, hero, legs, permanent,\r\npitch, stack, and weapon.\r\n3.0.1a A zone is considered empty when it does not contain any objects. A zone does not cease to exist\r\nif it is empty.\r\n3.0.2. Each player has their own arms, arsenal, banished, chest, deck, graveyard, hand, head, hero, legs, and\r\npitch zones; and has two weapon zones. The stack zone, permanent zone, and combat chain zone are\r\nshared by all players.\r\nNote: Cards printed before 2023 have used the phrase “zone you control” which refers to a\r\nzone that the player owns.\r\n3.0.3. An object can have one of two possible states of visibility: public, or private. A public object is an\r\nobject where information about the properties of the object is currently available to all players. A private\r\nobject is an object where the information about the properties of that object is not currently available to\r\nall players.\r\n3.0.3a A player may look at any private object they own, or is in a zone that they own, unless the object\r\nis in the deck zone.\r\n3.0.4. A public zone is a zone in which the default visibility of objects is public. A private zone is a zone in\r\nwhich the default visibility of objects is private.\r\n3.0.4a The arms, banished, chest, combat chain, graveyard, head, hero, legs, permanent, pitch, stack,\r\nand weapon zones are public zones.\r\n3.0.4b The arsenal, deck, and hand zones are private zones.\r\n3.0.4c A public zone may contain a private object, if the object is made private while in that zone, or if\r\nthe object is moved into that zone as a private object. The private object remains private until a rule\r\nor effect makes it public.\r\n3.0.4d A private zone may contain public objects if the object is made public while in that zone, or if\r\nthe object is moved into that zone as a public object. The public object remains public until a rule or\r\neffect makes it private.\r\n3.0.5. The arena is a collection of all the arms, chest, combat chain, head, hero, legs, permanent, and weapon\r\nzones.\r\n3.0.5a The arena is not a zone. If an object would be put into the arena by a rule or effect without\r\nspecifying a zone, it is placed into the permanent zone as a permanent.\r\n3.0.5b The arsenal, banished, deck, graveyard, hand, pitch, and stack zones are not part of the arena.\r\n25\r\nCHAPTER 3. ZONES\r\n3.0.6. The position of each player’s zones is determined by Figure 3.1. Head, chest, arms, and legs zones are\r\non the left; with the head zone directly above, arms zone directly right, and legs zone directly below, the\r\nchest zone. Hero, weapon, and arsenal zones are in the center; with the two weapon zones both directly\r\nleft and right, and the arsenal zone directly below, the hero zone. Graveyard, pitch, deck, and banished\r\nzones are on the right; with the graveyard zone directly above, the pitch zone directly left, and the\r\nbanished zone directly below, the deck zone.\r\n3.0.6a A player may swap the positions of their zones by mirroring the layout. That is; a player may\r\nswap the position of the head and graveyard zones, chest and deck zones, arms and pitch zones, and\r\nlegs and banished zones.\r\n3.0.6b A player’s hand zone does not have a specified location; it is instead held by the player.\r\n3.0.6c The permanent and stack zones do not have a specified location; objects in these zones can be\r\nplaced anywhere on the play-space except any other zone.\r\n3.0.6d If an additional zone of an existing type and ownership is created by a rule or effect, the zone is\r\npositioned adjacent to the existing zones of the same type and ownership.\r\n3.0.7. When an object moves from one zone to another, the object leaving its old zone (origin) and the object\r\nentering its new zone (destination) is performed simultaneously. At no point is the object not in a zone.\r\n3.0.7a The object as it leaves the origin is considered the object moving for rules and effects. If the\r\nobject is private when it moves zones, it is considered to have no properties for effects.\r\nExample: Levia has the text “While a card with 6 or more {p} has been put into your banished\r\nzone this turn, [...]”, which is a while-conditional static effect. If a card is banished and it has\r\n4 {p} as it leaves its origin, but 6 {p} when it enters the banished zone, it does not meet the\r\ncondition of the effect. If a card is banished and it is private as it leaves its origin, it does not\r\nmeet the condition of the effect.\r\n3.0.7b If the origin and the destination of a move are the same, then no move occurs. If the object would\r\ngo from public to private during the move, it just becomes private instead. If the object would go\r\nfrom private to public during the move, it just becomes public instead.\r\n3.0.8. If a private object will move zones and be public at the destination, it becomes public before it is\r\nmoved. If a public object will move zones and be private at the destination, it becomes private before it\r\nis moved.\r\nExample: Azalea’s activated ability puts a card from the deck (private object) into the arsenal\r\nface-up (public object in a private zone), therefore it becomes public before it is moved.\r\nExample: Intimidate puts a card from hand (private object) into the banished zone face down\r\n(private object in a public zone), therefore it does not become public before it is moved.\r\n3.0.8a If the destination of an object is replaced after the object becomes public, then Rule 3.0.8 is re\u0002evaluated based on whether it will be a public or private object at the new destination.\r\n26\r\nCHAPTER 3. ZONES\r\nExample: Drone of Brutality has the text “If Drone of Brutality would be put into your\r\ngraveyard from anywhere, instead put it on the bottom of your deck.”. If Drone of Brutality is\r\ndiscarded (from the private hand zone to the public graveyard zone), the card first becomes a\r\npublic object, then the replacement effect replaces the destination to be the deck (a private\r\nzone), the card becomes a private object, and finally, the cards are moved to the bottom of the\r\ndeck.\r\n3.0.9. If an object that enters a zone that is not in the arena and is not the stack zone, or a public object\r\nbecomes a private object, it ceases to exist and becomes a new object with no relation to its previous\r\nexistence.\r\nExample: Endless Arrow is played and during the reaction step, Snapdragon Scalers is activated\r\nto give it “go again”. Endless Arrow hits and returns to the player’s hand (a zone outside the\r\narena) and therefore becomes a new object. If the player plays Endless Arrow again it will not have\r\n“go again” because it is a new Endless Arrow card with no relation to its previous existence.\r\n3.0.9a An ability that triggers when an object moves from one zone to another still references the new\r\nobject, as long as the object remains a public object.\r\nExample: Merciful Retribution has the text “Whenever an aura or attack action card you\r\ncontrol is destroyed, [...] If it’s a non-token Light card, put it into your hero’s soul.”. If a\r\nnon-token Light card in the arena is destroyed, it moves to the graveyard and becomes a new\r\nobject. However, because Merciful Retribution triggers on the object moving to the graveyard\r\n(as part of its destruction) it still references the new object it becomes in that zone for the\r\ntriggered-layer it produces. If the non-token Light card moves to another zone or becomes\r\nprivate before the layer resolves, the triggered-layer loses that reference.\r\n3.0.9b An ability with an effect that moves an object from one zone to another still references the new\r\nobject for the remainder of any effects it generates, as long as the object remains a public object.\r\nExample: Bull’s Eye Bracers has the text “If you have no cards in your arsenal, you may put\r\nan arrow card from your hand face up into your arsenal. It gains +1{p} until end of turn.”. If\r\nan arrow card is put into the arsenal, it becomes a new object. However, because the activated\r\nability of Bull’s Eye Bracers was the source of the effect that moved the arrow card, the rest of\r\nthe effect still references the new object it became in that zone.\r\n3.0.10. Zones of the same type are independent of their creation method. If a rule or effect creates a zone of\r\nthe same type as an existing zone, the created zone is not distinguishable as being created by that rule or\r\neffect - only that there is now an additional zone of that type.\r\n3.0.10a If a rule or effect moves an object into a specified type of zone, and there are two or more zones\r\nthat match the specified type, the player that owns the object chooses which zone that object is\r\nmoved to.\r\n3.0.10b If the zone of a player ceases to exist, and there is only one of that type of zone owned by the\r\nplayer, any cards in that zone are cleared and the zone ceases to exist.\r\n3.0.10c If the zone of a player ceases to exist, and there are two or more of that type of zone owned by\r\nthe player, an empty zone of that type owned by the player ceases to exist. If there are no zones of\r\nthat type owned by the player that are empty, the player chooses which zone will cease to exist - any\r\ncards in that zone are cleared and the zone ceases to exist.\r\n27\r\nCHAPTER 3. ZONES\r\nFigure 3.1: The official layout of a player’s zones from the perspective of the player looking down. The combat\r\nchain zone is shared by all players. A player’s hand zone is held by the player. The permanent and stack zones do\r\nnot have a specified location.\r\n3.0.11. If a rule will move an object to a zone that does not exist, or the zone can not contain that object, the\r\nobject is moved to the graveyard instead. If an effect would move an object to a zone that does not exist,\r\nor the zone can not contain that object, that effect simply fails.\r\n3.0.12. To clear an object, move it from its current zone to its owner’s graveyard.\r\n3.0.12a If the object is a token or a non-card-layer, it leaves its current zone and simply ceases to exist.\r\n3.0.13. If an effect refers to one or more zones without specifying the owner of those zones (or specifying\r\n“any”), it refers to the zones owned by the controller of the effect.\r\n3.0.14. A sub-object is a card or token that is under a permanent. A top-object is the permanent the\r\nsub-object is underneath.\r\n3.0.14a A card or token is only considered to be under a permanent if specified by an effect.\r\n3.0.14b A sub-object is not considered to be in the arena, even if its top-object is in the arena.\r\n3.0.14c If a top-object moves zones and remains the same object, its sub-objects move to the same zone\r\nas part of the same event and remain sub-objects.\r\n3.0.14d If the top-object is public, all sub-objects are also public. If a top-object is private, all\r\nsub-objects are also private.\r\n3.0.14e If a top-object ceases to exist, its sub-objects are cleared as part of the same event. (See Rule\r\n3.0.12)\r\n28\r\nCHAPTER 3. ZONES\r\n3.1. Arms\r\n3.1.1. An arms zone is a public zone in the arena, owned by a player.\r\n3.1.2. An arms zone can only contain up to one object which is equipped to that zone. (See Rule 8.5.35)\r\n3.1.2a An object can only be equipped to an arms zone if it has subtype arms.\r\n3.1.3. A player may equip an arms card to their arms zone at the start of the game. (See Section 4.1 - Starting\r\na Game)\r\n3.2. Arsenal\r\n3.2.1. An arsenal zone is a private zone outside the arena, owned by a player.\r\n3.2.2. An arsenal zone can only contain up to one of its owner’s deck-cards. (See Rule 1.3.1b)\r\n3.2.2a If an effect would put a card into an arsenal zone that is not empty, or into the arsenal and there\r\nare no empty arsenal zones, that effect fails.\r\n3.2.3. The term “arsenal” refers to all arsenal zones owned by a player and the cards in those zones.\r\n3.2.3a A player’s arsenal is considered empty if all of their arsenal zones are empty.\r\n3.2.3b If a rule or effect would specify a card to move into a player’s arsenal, it is moved into one of\r\ntheir empty arsenal zones.\r\n3.2.4. Cards in an arsenal zone may be played. (See Section 5.1 - Playing Cards)\r\n3.3. Banished\r\n3.3.1. A banished zone is a public zone outside the arena, owned by a player.\r\n3.3.2. A banished zone can only contain its owner’s cards.\r\n3.4. Chest\r\n3.4.1. A chest zone is a public zone in the arena, owned by a player.\r\n3.4.2. A chest zone can only contain up to one object which is equipped to that zone. (See Rule 8.5.35)\r\n3.4.2a An object can only be equipped to a chest zone if it has subtype chest.\r\n3.4.3. A player may equip a chest card to their chest zone at the start of the game. (See Section 4.1 - Starting\r\na Game)\r\n3.5. Combat Chain\r\n3.5.1. The combat chain zone is a public zone in the arena. There is only one combat chain zone, shared by\r\nall players, and it does not have an owner.\r\n3.5.2. The term “combat chain” refers to the combat chain zone.\r\n29\r\nCHAPTER 3. ZONES\r\n3.5.3. The combat chain is “open” during combat - otherwise it is “closed”. (See Chapter 7 - Combat)\r\n3.5.4. A chain link is an element of a sequence of attacks on the combat chain. A chain link is represented by\r\nan attack. A combat chain has zero or more chain links.\r\n3.5.4a If an attack is added onto the combat chain as a chain link, it becomes chain link N + 1, where\r\nN is the number of existing chain links on the combat chain. Chain link N (if any) becomes the\r\n“previous chain link” and chain link N + 1 becomes the “current chain link”, until the combat chain\r\ncloses.\r\n3.5.4b If an attack that represents a chain link ceases to exist, or ceases to represent the chain link, the\r\nchain link itself continues to exist, and rules and effects use the last known information about the\r\nattack. (See Rule 1.2.5)\r\nExample: If a Dawnblade represents chain link 1 as an attack on the combat chain, and then is\r\nattacked with again and becomes chain link 2 on the same combat chain; the Dawnblade\r\nceases to represent chain link 1 but it will continue to exist and Last Known Information about\r\nthe Dawnblade as an attack is used for rules and effects that specifically refer to that chain link\r\nor attack.\r\n3.5.4c A chain link and objects on a chain link are considered to be in the arena. Abilities of a chain\r\nlink and objects on a chain link are typically considered functional with the exception of\r\nnon-permanent defending objects (see Rule 1.7.5 and Rule 3.5.4d).\r\n3.5.4d Defending objects are objects that are designated to be defending by a rule or effect (see Rule\r\n7.3.2 and Rule 7.4.2d). Defending objects on a chain link are considered to be defending that chain\r\nlink until they leave the combat chain. Defending objects are placed on the chain link of the attack\r\nthey are defending and remain there until the combat chain closes.\r\n3.5.4e The controller of a chain link is the same as the attack that represents it.\r\n3.5.4f The owner of a chain link is the same as the attack that represents it.\r\n3.6. Deck\r\n3.6.1. A deck zone is a private zone outside the arena, owned by a player.\r\n3.6.2. A deck zone can only contain its owner’s deck-cards. (See Rule 1.3.1b)\r\n3.6.3. The term “deck” refers to the deck zone.\r\n3.6.4. A player can not look at objects in their own deck zone unless specified by a rule or effect.\r\n3.6.5. Objects in the deck zone are placed face down in an ordered uniform pile.\r\n3.6.6. A player’s starting deck starts the game in their deck zone. (See Section 4.1 - Starting a Game)\r\n3.7. Graveyard\r\n3.7.1. A graveyard zone is a public zone outside the arena, owned by a player.\r\n3.7.2. A graveyard zone can only contain its owner’s cards.\r\n30\r\nCHAPTER 3. ZONES\r\n3.7.3. The term “graveyard” refers to the graveyard zone.\r\n3.8. Hand\r\n3.8.1. A hand zone is a private zone outside the arena, owned by a player.\r\n3.8.2. A hand zone can only contain its owner’s deck-cards. (See Rule 1.3.1b)\r\n3.8.3. The term “hand” refers to the hand zone.\r\n3.9. Head\r\n3.9.1. A head zone is a public zone in the arena, owned by a player.\r\n3.9.2. A head zone can only contain up to one object which is equipped to that zone. (See Rule 8.5.35)\r\n3.9.2a An object can only be equipped to a head zone if it has subtype head.\r\n3.9.3. A player may equip a head card to their head zone at the start of the game. (See Section 4.1 - Starting a\r\nGame)\r\n3.10. Hero\r\n3.10.1. A hero zone is a public zone in the arena, owned by a player.\r\n3.10.2. A hero zone can only contain one card, with the type hero, and zero or more cards in the hero’s soul.\r\n3.10.3. The term “hero” refers to the card with the type hero in the hero zone.\r\n3.10.4. A player must start the game with their hero card in their hero zone. (See Section 4.1 - Starting a\r\nGame)\r\n3.10.5. A hero’s soul refers to the collection of sub-objects under the hero card. (See Rule 3.0.14)\r\n3.11. Legs\r\n3.11.1. A legs zone is a public zone in the arena, owned by a player.\r\n3.11.2. A legs zone can only contain up to one object which is equipped to that zone. (See Rule 8.5.35)\r\n3.11.2a An object can only be equipped to a legs zone if it has subtype legs.\r\n3.11.3. A player may equip a legs card to their legs zone at the start of the game. (See Section 4.1 - Starting a\r\nGame)\r\n3.12. Permanent\r\n3.12.1. The permanent zone is a public zone in the arena. There is only one permanent zone, shared by all\r\nplayers, and it does not have an owner.\r\n3.12.2. The permanent zone can only contain permanents.\r\n31\r\nCHAPTER 3. ZONES\r\n3.13. Pitch\r\n3.13.1. A pitch zone is a public zone outside the arena, owned by a player.\r\n3.13.2. A pitch zone can only contain its owner’s deck-cards. (See Rule 1.3.1b)\r\n3.14. Stack\r\n3.14.1. The stack zone is a public zone outside the arena. There is only one stack zone, shared by all players,\r\nand it does not have an owner.\r\n3.14.2. The term “stack” refers to the stack zone.\r\n3.14.3. The stack contains an ordered collection of layers. (See Section 1.6 - Layers)\r\n3.14.4. When a layer is added onto the stack, it becomes layer N + 1 where N is the number of existing\r\nlayers on the stack.\r\n3.14.5. The top layer of the stack is layer N, with the highest value of N.\r\n3.14.6. When a layer N is removed from the stack by a rule or effect, any layer M where M > N becomes\r\nlayer M − 1.\r\nExample: There are 4 layers on the stack. Layer 2 is an instant card and is removed by a “negate”\r\neffect. Layer 3 becomes layer 2, and layer 4 becomes layer 3, while layer 1 remains unchanged.\r\n3.15. Weapon\r\n3.15.1. A weapon zone is a public zone in the arena, owned by a player.\r\n3.15.2. A weapon zone can only contain up to one object which is equipped to that zone. (See Rule 8.5.35)\r\n3.15.2a An object can only be equipped to a weapon zone if it has the type weapon or the subtype off\u0002hand. An object with the subtype (2H) must be equipped to two weapon zones. (See Rule 8.2.2)\r\n3.15.3. A player may equip a weapon card or an off-hand card to their weapon zone at the start of the game.\r\n(See Section 4.1 - Starting a Game)\r\n32\r\n4. Game Structure\r\n4.0. General\r\n4.0.1. A game of Flesh and Blood is preceded by the start-of-game procedure and ends when a player wins or\r\nthe game is a draw. (See Section 4.1 - Starting a Game and Section 4.5 - Ending a Game)\r\n4.0.2. A match consists of one or more consecutive games between the same players with the same decks.\r\n4.0.3. A turn is a game state concept that structures the order of play and phases.\r\n4.0.3a A turn consists of 3 phases in order: Start Phase, Action Phase, and End Phase.\r\n4.0.3b Only one player can have a turn at any point in time. A player whose turn it is is the “turn\r\nplayer”. A player whose turn it is not is a “non-turn player”.\r\n4.1. Starting a Game\r\n4.1.1. The process of starting a game is referred to as the start-of-game procedure. Players do not get priority\r\nduring the start-of-game procedure.\r\n4.1.2. First, each player places their hero card face up in their hero zone.\r\n4.1.3. Second, a player is selected and chooses the first-turn player. If it is the first game of a match, one of\r\nthe players is selected using a random method that is mutually agreeable. If it is not the first game of a\r\nmatch, the player who lost first in the previous game of the match is the selected player; or if the\r\nprevious game ended in a draw, the selected player is the same as in the previous game. The select\r\nplayer then chooses any player to be the first-turn player.\r\n4.1.4. Third, each player selects arena-cards from their card-pool that they will start the game with. (See\r\nRule 1.3.1b)\r\n4.1.4a A player may select up to one arena-card for each of their arms, chest, head, legs, and weapon\r\nzones. Each card will start the game equipped in its respective zone, based on its type and/or\r\nsubtype. (See Rule 4.1.8)\r\n4.1.4b Cards selected this way are placed face-down in their respective zones or in a single face-down\r\npile next to the hero. These cards and their number are private to each player until the game begins.\r\n4.1.5. Fourth, each player selects the deck-cards from their card-pool that will become their deck.\r\n4.1.5a Arena-cards can not be included in a player’s deck.\r\n4.1.5b If a meta-static ability effect allows the player to start the game with one or more cards in a zone\r\nother than their deck, these cards are selected from their deck and placed face-down in their\r\nrespective zones or in the single face-down pile next to the hero. The cards selected this way are still\r\nconsidered part of the player’s deck. These cards and their number are private to each player until\r\nthe game begins.\r\n33\r\nCHAPTER 4. GAME STRUCTURE\r\nExample: Dash has the text “You may start the game with a Mechanologist item with cost\r\n{r}{r} or less in the arena.”, which means if the game format requires a starting deck of 40\r\ncards, the player may select the specified from those 40 cards, and start the game with 1 card\r\nin the arena and 39 cards in their deck zone.\r\n4.1.6. Fifth, all other cards in a player’s card-pool that were not selected during Rule 4.1.4 or Rule 4.1.5\r\nbecome that player’s inventory.\r\n4.1.6a An inventory is a defined collection of cards in the game - it is not a zone.\r\n4.1.6b An inventory is private. Players may look at cards in their own inventory during a game but are\r\nnot required to show any other player.\r\n4.1.6c If one or more cards remaining in the player’s card-pool fail to meet the specifications of a rule or\r\neffect at the start of the game, those cards are removed from the game and are not considered part of\r\nthe inventory for the game.\r\nExample: Taylor has the text “Each equipment in your starting inventory must have a different\r\nname.”, which means if there are two or more cards with the same name remaining in the\r\nplayer’s card-pool, the first one is included in the player’s inventory and the second one is\r\nremoved from the game.\r\n4.1.7. Sixth, each player shuffles and presents their starting deck to an opponent to be shuffled and/or cut.\r\n4.1.7a After a player has presented their starting deck to be shuffled and/or cut, it is placed in their deck\r\nzone and they may no longer change any cards they have chosen in Rule 4.1.4 and Rule 4.1.5.\r\n4.1.7b A starting deck is private to each player. The opponent may not look at the information of the\r\ncards in a deck presented to them.\r\n4.1.8. Seventh, each player equips their respective weapons and equipment (see Rule 8.5.35). Any other\r\ncards that start the game in a zone other than the deck zone are put in their respective zones. The “start\r\nof the game” event occurs and effects that trigger at the start of the game are triggered. Layers on the\r\nstack resolve and additional triggered-layers are added as if all players are passing priority in succession.\r\n4.1.8a If two or more triggered-layers are created, they are added to the stack in an order chosen by the\r\nfirst-turn player. (See Rule 1.10.2c)\r\n4.1.9. Eighth and finally, each player draws cards up to their hero’s intellect and the first turn player begins\r\ntheir Start Phase.\r\n4.2. Start Phase\r\n4.2.1. Players do not get priority during the Start Phase.\r\n4.2.2. First, the turn starts. Effects that last until the “start of turn” end. The “start of turn” event occurs and\r\neffects that trigger at the start of turn are triggered. Layers on the stack resolve and additional triggered\u0002layers are added as if all players are passing priority in succession.\r\n4.2.3. Second and finally, when the stack is empty, the Start Phase ends and the game proceeds to the action\r\nphase.\r\n34\r\nCHAPTER 4. GAME STRUCTURE\r\n4.3. Action Phase\r\n4.3.1. First, the action phase starts. The “beginning of the action phase” event occurs and effects that trigger\r\nat the beginning of the action phase are triggered.\r\n4.3.2. Second, the turn player has 1 action point.\r\n4.3.2a Effects that trigger when a player gains an action point do not trigger when the turn player gains\r\nan action point this way.\r\n4.3.2b Replacement effects that modify events when a player gains an action point do not modify or\r\nreplace when the turn player gains an action point this way.\r\n4.3.3. Third, the turn player gains priority.\r\n4.3.4. Fourth and finally, when the stack is empty, the combat chain is closed, and both players pass priority\r\nin succession, the action phase ends and the game proceeds to the End Phase.\r\n4.4. End Phase\r\n4.4.1. Players do not get priority during the End Phase.\r\n4.4.2. First, the “beginning of the end phase” event occurs and effects that trigger at the beginning of the end\r\nphase are triggered. Layers on the stack resolve and additional triggered-layers are added as if all players\r\nare passing priority in succession.\r\n4.4.3. Second, when the stack is empty, the end-of-turn procedure occurs. After each step in the end-of-turn\r\nprocedure, if a triggered effect has triggered, the triggered-layers are added to the stack; then layers on\r\nthe stack resolve, and additional triggered-layers are added as if all players are passing priority in\r\nsuccession. The end-of-turn procedure happens in the following order:\r\n4.4.3a All allies’ life totals are reset to their base life, modified by any counters on the object.\r\n4.4.3b The turn player may put a card from their hand face-down into an empty arsenal zone they own.\r\n4.4.3c Each player puts all cards in their pitch zone (if any) on the bottom of their deck in any order.\r\nThe order cards are put on the bottom of the deck this way is hidden information.\r\n4.4.3d All players lose all action points and resources.\r\n4.4.3e The turn player draws cards until the number of cards in their hand is equal to their hero’s\r\nintellect {i}. If it is the first turn of the game, all other players draw cards until the number of cards\r\nin their hand is equal to their hero’s intellect {i}. If a player already has at least that many cards in\r\ntheir hand, they do not draw any cards this way. (See Rule 8.5.6)\r\n4.4.4. Third and finally, the turn ends. Effects that last until the “until end of turn” and “this turn” end. The\r\nnext player in clockwise order becomes the new turn player (see Rule 1.1.6). The new turn player begins\r\ntheir Start Phase.\r\n4.5. Ending a Game\r\n4.5.1. A game ends immediately when a player wins, or the game is a draw.\r\n35\r\nCHAPTER 4. GAME STRUCTURE\r\n4.5.1a If a player loses a game and the game does not end, all objects the player controls are cleared,\r\nand then the player and all cards they own are removed from the game. Non-card objects owned by\r\nthe player but created under the control of another player remain in the game and under that player’s\r\ncontrol.\r\n4.5.2. A player can win the game in the following ways:\r\n4.5.2a A player wins the game if all of their opponents have lost the game.\r\n4.5.2b A player wins the game if an effect states that they win the game.\r\n4.5.3. A player can lose the game in the following ways:\r\n4.5.3a A player loses the game if their hero’s life total is reduced to zero.\r\n4.5.3b A player loses the game if an effect states that they lose the game.\r\n4.5.3c A player loses the game if they concede.\r\n4.5.4. The game can be a draw for the remaining players in the following ways:\r\n4.5.4a The game is a draw for the remaining players if all remaining players’ hero’s life totals are\r\nsimultaneously reduced to zero.\r\nExample: There are 2 remaining players. One player plays and resolves Forked Lightning,\r\ntargeting both themselves and their opponent. Neither player prevents any arcane damage and\r\nboth their life totals are simultaneously reduced to zero, resulting in a draw.\r\n4.5.4b The game is a draw for the remaining players if an effect states that the game is a draw.\r\n4.5.4c The game is a draw for the remaining players if all remaining players agree to an intentional\r\ndraw. The remaining players can agree to a draw at any time.\r\n4.5.4d The game is a draw for the remaining players if a stalemate occurs. A stalemate happens when\r\nno remaining player can legally advance the game state toward ending the game.\r\nExample: There are 2 remaining players. Both players only have a Cracked Bauble in their\r\nhand, no cards in the arena, or cards in their deck, arsenal, or banished zone. Both players\r\ncontrol a weapon without an attack ability or an ability that would reduce life totals, so they\r\nhave no way of advancing the game state to a conclusion. Therefore the game ends in a draw\r\nbecause both players are stalemated.\r\n4.5.4e The game is a draw for the remaining players if a deadlock occurs. A deadlock happens when all\r\nremaining players refuse to legally advance the game state toward ending the game.\r\nExample: There are 2 remaining players on 1 life total. Both players only have Invert\r\nExistence and a Cracked Bauble in their hand, no equipment, weapon, or cards in their deck,\r\narsenal, or banished zone. The first person to play Invert Existence will lose the game because\r\nthe opposing player can respond with their Invert Existence which will resolve first and give\r\nthem the win. Therefore the game ends in a draw because both players are deadlocked.\r\n36\r\n5. Layers, Cards, & Abilities\r\n5.0. General\r\n5.1. Playing Cards\r\n5.1.1. To play a card is to move it to the stack as a card-layer (see Rule 1.6.1a). Only a card’s owner can play\r\nit unless otherwise specified by a rule or effect. Playing a card involves the following steps in order:\r\nAnnounce, Declare Costs, Declare Modes and Targets, Check Legal Play, Calculate Asset-Costs, Pay\r\nAsset-Costs, Calculate Effect-Costs, Pay Effect-Costs, and Play.\r\n5.1.1a A player can only play cards from their hand or arsenal zones unless otherwise specified by a rule\r\nor effect.\r\n5.1.2. Announce: First, the player proposes the card to be played. The card moves to the stack zone under\r\nthat player’s control and becomes the topmost layer of the stack.\r\n5.1.2a Effects that apply to the next card played are applied if the card matches the effect description.\r\nExample: There are three continuous effects active: “The next attack action card you play\r\ngains +3{p}.”, “Action cards cost {r} less to play.”, and “Attacks you control have +3{p}”.\r\nWhen an attack action card is proposed to be played and is moved to the stack under the\r\nplayer’s control, all three effects begin to apply immediately.\r\n5.1.2b A card may only be announced to be played if a rule or existing effect allows it to be played.\r\nExample: Tome of Torment has the text “You may play Tome of Torment from your banished\r\nzone.” which is a play-static ability that when functional, allows it to be played from the\r\nbanished zone. If Tome of Torment is private (face-down) in the banished zone, its play-static\r\nability is not functional and therefore it can not be announced to be played.\r\n5.1.3. Declare Costs: Second, the player declares the parameters for any costs of the proposed card.\r\n5.1.3a If the card has a variable cost (the cost includes X), the player must declare the value of X (see\r\nRule 1.12.2).\r\n5.1.3b If the card has additional costs that are optional, the player must declare all additional costs that\r\nwill be paid.\r\n5.1.3c If the card has an alternative cost, the player must declare if the alternative cost will be paid. If a\r\ncard has two or more alternative costs, the player may only select a single alternative cost (if any) to\r\nbe paid.\r\n5.1.3d If the card has the type action and it may be played as an instant, the player declares whether or\r\nnot they are playing the card as an instant.\r\n5.1.3e If there are two or more effect-costs to be paid, the player declares the order those costs will be\r\npaid.\r\n5.1.4. Declare Modes and Targets: Third, the player declares the parameters of all resolution abilities.\r\n37\r\nCHAPTER 5. LAYERS, CARDS, & ABILITIES\r\n5.1.4a If the card has any modal resolution abilities, the player must declare the modes for those\r\nabilities (see Rule 1.7.6). Then, if any resolution abilities generate effects that require a target, the\r\nplayer must declare all legal targets for those effects Rule 1.8.4.\r\n5.1.4b If the card is an attack, the player must declare any additional parameters of the attack (see Rule\r\n7.0.5).\r\n5.1.5. Check Legal Play: Fourth, the card is evaluated if it is legal to play before any costs are paid. If a rule\r\nor effect prevents the card from being played, or the parameters of the proposed card are illegal, the card\r\nis illegal to play and the game state is reversed to before the card was announced. (See Section 1.10.3 -\r\nGame State)\r\n5.1.6. Calculate Asset-Costs: Fifth, all asset-costs of the proposed card are calculated. (See Section 1.13 -\r\nAssets)\r\n5.1.6a First, rules define the starting asset-cost. Second, effects that set an asset-cost are applied. Third,\r\neffects that increase an asset-cost are applied. Fourth and finally, effects that reduce an asset-cost are\r\napplied - if an effect would reduce an asset-cost to be less than zero, it instead reduces it to zero. If\r\ntwo or more effects are applied at each step, then they are applied in timestamp order Rule 6.3.4.\r\n5.1.6b The action asset-cost starts at zero. If the card has the type action and is not played as an instant,\r\nthe action cost starts at one instead.\r\n5.1.6c The resource asset-cost starts at the base resource cost of a card being played. If an alternative\r\ncost is declared that replaces the resource asset-cost for playing the card, then the resource asset-cost\r\nstarts at zero instead.\r\n5.1.7. Pay Asset-Costs: Sixth, the player pays all asset-costs (if any) (see Rule 1.14.2a).\r\n5.1.7a If any asset-cost is not paid in full, the card is illegal to play and the game state is reversed to\r\nbefore the card is announced. (See Section 1.10.3 - Game State)\r\n5.1.8. Calculate Effect-Costs: Seventh, all effect-costs of the proposed cards are calculated.\r\n5.1.8a If any effect-cost can not be paid, based on the order declared by the player, the card is illegal to\r\nplay and the game state is reversed to before the card was announced. (See Section 1.10.3 - Game\r\nState)\r\n5.1.9. Pay Effect-Costs: Eighth, the player pays all effect-costs.\r\n5.1.9a If a replacement effect modifies an effect-cost, and that cost cannot be paid (the effect does not\r\nresolve successfully), the card can still be played.\r\n5.1.10. Play: Ninth and finally, the card is now considered played and the player regains priority.\r\n5.2. Activated Abilities\r\n5.2.1. An activated ability is an ability that can be activated to put an activated-layer on the stack. Activated\r\nabilities are always written in the format “[LIMIT?] [TYPE] — [COST]: [ABILITIES]\r\n[CONDITION?]”.\r\n38\r\nCHAPTER 5. LAYERS, CARDS, & ABILITIES\r\n5.2.1a The LIMIT (if any) is written at the start of the ability and specifies the maximum number of\r\ntimes the ability can be activated. If there is no limit, the ability can be activated any number of\r\ntimes.\r\n5.2.1b The TYPE is written directly before the hyphen and specifies the type of the ability and the type\r\nof the activated-layer created by activating the ability.\r\n5.2.1c The COST is written between the dash and colon. It specifies the cost to be paid to activate the\r\nability. A cost of “0” specifies the resource cost to activate the ability is zero.\r\n5.2.1d The ABILITIES are written after the colon and specify the base abilities of the activated-layer.\r\nWhen the activated-layer resolves, the resolution abilities of the layer generate effects.\r\n5.2.1e The CONDITION (if any) is written at the end of the ability and specifies the activation\r\ncondition. If the activated ability has an activation condition and that condition is not met, the ability\r\ncan not be activated.\r\n5.2.2. To activate an activated ability is to create an activated-layer on the stack. A player can only activate\r\nan ability if the ability is functional (see Rule 1.7.5) and the player controls its source (or owns its source\r\nif there is no controller), unless otherwise specified by a rule or effect. Only an object’s controller can\r\nactivate its activated ability unless specified by a rule or effect. Activating an activated ability involves\r\nthe following:\r\n5.2.2a Announce the activated ability to be activated. The activated-layer is created in the stack zone\r\nunder that player’s control and becomes the topmost layer of the stack. The activated-layer is\r\ncreated with the same supertypes and types as the source of the activated ability. Continuous effects\r\nbegin to apply to the ability layer.\r\n5.2.2b The remainder of the process for activating an activated ability is identical to the process for\r\nplaying a card listed in steps 5.1.3-5.1.10, substituting “play” for ‘activate‘, and “card” for “ability”.\r\n5.2.3. If an effect allows an ability to be activated additional times, that activated ability may be activated to\r\nexceed its LIMIT by the specified amount of times.\r\n5.2.3a If an effect allows all abilities on an object to be activated additional times and the object has two\r\nor more activated abilities, each activated ability of that object can be activated additional times.\r\nExample: Snap Shot has the text “[...] you may activate abilities of bows you control an\r\nadditional time this turn and as though they were an instant.”, which allows each individual\r\nactivated ability on bows the player controls to be activated an additional time.\r\n5.2.3b If an effect allows an object to be activated additional times and the object has two or more\r\nactivated abilities, the effect applies at the time the ability is activated beyond its LIMIT. The total\r\nnumber of additional activations may be spread across all activated abilities on the object.\r\nExample: Tri-shot has the text “You may activate target bow you control 2 additional times\r\nthis turn.”, which allows the activated abilities on the target bow to be activated a combined\r\ntotal of 2 additional times.\r\n5.2.3c If an effect allows a source to attack additional times, it refers to activating an ability on the\r\nsource with the attack ability (Rule 8.3.1) or attack effect (Rule 8.5.33).\r\n39\r\nCHAPTER 5. LAYERS, CARDS, & ABILITIES\r\nExample: Twinning Blade has the text “You may attack an additional time with target sword\r\nthis turn.”, which allows the player to activate an activated ability (with the attack\r\nability/effect) on the target sword an additional time past its LIMIT.\r\n5.2.3d Effects that allow the additional activation of an activated ability are additive. If two or more\r\neffects would allow an activated ability to be activated beyond its LIMIT, the player chooses which\r\nof those effects apply to the activation.\r\n5.2.3e Effects that state how many times an ability can be activated in total, set the LIMIT of the\r\nactivated ability (or the total number of times that all activated abilities), which can be surpassed by\r\neffects that allow the ability to be activated additional times.\r\nExample: Blood on Her Hands has the text “[...] Target 1H weapon may attack twice this\r\nturn.”, which is an effect that sets the total number of times an activated ability (with the attack\r\neffect) can be activated on the target to two. If this effect is applied two or more times, the\r\nactivated ability (with the attack effect) can still only be activated twice.\r\n5.2.4. A hidden activated ability (HAA) is an activated ability that is functional when its source is a private\r\nobject (and not in the deck zone). A hidden activated ability is typically written in the format “[LIMIT?]\r\n[TYPE] — [COST]: [ABILITIES] [CONDITION]”, where the CONDITION specifies the privacy status\r\nand/or zone of the object for the ability to be functional.\r\n5.2.4a When the activation condition for a hidden activated ability is met and the owner has priority,\r\nthe owner may activate the ability. If they do, the source of the ability becomes public and remains\r\npublic until the activated-layer resolves or otherwise ceases to exist. When an object becomes public\r\nthis way, it does not trigger any abilities and can not be replaced by any replacement effects.\r\n5.3. Resolution Abilities & Resolving Layers\r\n5.3.1. A resolution ability is an ability that generates effects when its source resolves as a layer on the stack.\r\n5.3.2. If the stack is not empty and all players pass in succession, the top layer of the stack resolves (with the\r\nexception of the Layer step of combat Section 7.1 - Layer Step). When a layer successfully resolves, the\r\nresolution abilities of that layer generate their effects.\r\n5.3.2a If a layer fails to resolve, the resolution abilities of that layer do not generate their effects.\r\n5.3.2b If the parameters of any effects of a resolution ability are undetermined, those parameters are\r\ndetermined before those effects are generated. (See Rule 1.8.5)\r\n5.3.2c If the resolution of a layer generates two or more effects, effects are generated immediately and\r\nin the order specified by the resolution abilities. If any generated effect fails, the remaining effects\r\ncontinue to be generated.\r\n5.3.3. A layer can fail to resolve in the following situations:\r\n5.3.3a If the layer has a resolution ability with a targeted effect, and one or more targets were declared\r\nwhen the layer was put onto the stack, at least one of those targets must still be a legal target -\r\notherwise, the layer fails to resolve.\r\n5.3.3b If the layer is a triggered-layer created by a triggered effect with a state-trigger condition, the\r\nstate-trigger condition must be met by the current game state - otherwise, the layer fails to resolve.\r\n40\r\nCHAPTER 5. LAYERS, CARDS, & ABILITIES\r\nExample: An attack with phantasm is defended by an attack action card with 6{p}. Before the\r\nphantasm triggered-layer effect resolves, the attacking hero plays Blinding Beam, giving the\r\ndefending card −2{p}. When the phantasm triggered-layer resolves, the game state condition\r\nthat caused phantasm to trigger is no longer true, therefore the phantasm triggered-layer fails\r\nto resolve and does not generate any effects.\r\n5.3.3c If the layer is an attack and the target of the attack is no longer legal. (See Rule 7.2.2)\r\n5.3.4. After a layer successfully resolves or fails to resolve, the layer is moved from the stack to the owner’s\r\ngraveyard, and the turn player gains priority, with the following exceptions:\r\n5.3.4a A non-card-layer ceases to exist instead of being moved to the graveyard.\r\n5.3.4b A card-layer that becomes a permanent is moved to the arena instead of being moved to the\r\ngraveyard. (See Rule 8.2.4, Rule 8.2.13, Rule 8.2.5, and Rule 8.2.9)\r\n5.3.4c A card with the type defense reaction becomes a defending card and is moved onto the current\r\nchain link instead of being moved to the graveyard. (See Rule 8.1.3)\r\n5.3.4d A rule or effect states that something happens where the turn player does not have priority\r\ninstead of the player gaining priority.\r\n5.4. Static Abilities\r\n5.4.1. A static ability is an ability that generates effects without resolving a layer on the stack. Static abilities\r\nare written as statements.\r\n5.4.2. Static abilities that are functional generate static continuous effects. (See Rule 6.2.3)\r\n5.4.3. A meta-static ability is a static ability that generates effects that apply to the rules outside of the game.\r\n5.4.3a If a meta-static ability that modifies rules outside the game ceases to exist during a game, it does\r\nnot affect the legality of the rules followed outside the game.\r\nExample: Shiyana, Diamond Gemini has the text “You may have specialization cards of any\r\nhero in your deck.”. If the player controlling Shiyana has specialization cards in their\r\ncard-pool, and Shiyana lost this meta static ability during a game, having specialization cards\r\nin the card-pool is still legal.\r\n5.4.4. A play-static ability is a static ability that generates effects that apply to the playing of its source card.\r\n5.4.4a An additional-cost ability is a play-static ability that adds one or more asset-costs and/or\r\neffect-costs to play the source card. Additional-cost abilities are typically written in the format “As\r\nan additional cost to play this [COST]”, where COST is the additional cost to be paid. An\r\nadditional-cost ability is optional if the COST of the ability uses the term “may” and must be\r\ndeclared when playing a card (see Rule 5.1.3).\r\n5.4.4b An alternative-cost ability is a play-static ability that replaces one or more asset-costs and/or\r\neffect-costs to play the source card. Alternative-cost abilities are typically written in the format “You\r\nmay [COST] rather than pay this’s [BASE]”, where COST is the alternative cost to be paid instead\r\nof the cards BASE asset-costs and/or effect-costs. Alternative-cost abilities are optional and must be\r\ndeclared when playing a card (see Rule 5.1.3). An alternative cost has no effect on any additional\r\ncosts that must be paid or modifications to the resource cost.\r\n41\r\nCHAPTER 5. LAYERS, CARDS, & ABILITIES\r\n5.4.4c If a play-static ability generates a triggered effect, the effect triggers immediately if the trigger\r\ncondition is met. Triggered effects of play-static abilities are typically written in the format\r\n“[EFFECT]. When you do, [Abilities]”, where the trigger condition is playing the card using the\r\nproceeding effect of the play-static ability.\r\nNote: Cards printed before 2022 have also used the format “[COST]. If you do,\r\n[ABILITIES]”.\r\nExample: Rift Bind has the text “You may play Rift Bind from your banished zone. If you do, it\r\ngains +X{p}, where X is the number of ’non-attack’ action cards you have played this turn.”,\r\nwhich is a play static ability that generates a delayed-triggered effect that is triggered when the\r\nRift Bind is played from the banished zone.\r\n5.4.4d If a play-static ability generates a replacement effect, the effect replaces the card as it is played if\r\nthe replacement condition is met. Replacement effects of play-static abilities are typically written in\r\nthe format “[EFFECT]. As you do, [Abilities]”, where the replacement condition is playing the card\r\nusing the proceeding effect of the play-static ability.\r\n5.4.5. A property-static ability is a static ability that defines the property, or value of a property, on an object\r\nthat would normally be found elsewhere on that object.\r\nExample: Mutated Mass has the text “Mutated Mass’s {p} and {d} is equal to twice the number\r\nof cards in your pitch zone with different costs.”, which is a property-static ability that defines the\r\npower and defense of the card, otherwise printed on the card with (*).\r\n5.4.5a Property-static abilities function anywhere in and outside the game.\r\n5.4.6. A triggered-static ability is a static ability that generates a single triggered effect. (See Section 6.6 -\r\nTriggered Effects)\r\n5.4.6a If the source of a triggered-static ability ceases to exist from an event that would trigger its effect,\r\nand the ability was functional immediately before the event occurs, then the triggered effect is\r\ntriggered.\r\nExample: Merciful Retribution has the text “Whenever an aura or attack action card you\r\ncontrol is destroyed, deal 1 arcane damage to target hero. [...]”. If Merciful Retribution is in\r\nthe arena under the control of a player and is destroyed, its triggered effect will trigger,\r\nbecause the destruction event of Merciful Retribution is also the condition of the effect.\r\n5.4.7. A while-static ability is a static ability with a condition that makes it functional under specified\r\ncircumstances. While-conditional abilities are written in the format “While [CONDITION],\r\n[ABILITY]” or “If [CONDITION], while [CONDITION], [ABILITY]”, where the ABILITY is the\r\nstatic ability that is functional whenever the CONDITION is met.\r\nExample: Yinti Yanti has the text “While Yinti Yanti is defending and you control an aura, it has +1\r\n{d} .”, which is a while-static ability that is functional when it is a non-permanent defending card\r\nbecause it has a while-condition that is met when the card is defending.\r\n5.4.7a A while-static ability is functional when its while-condition is met and when its source is public,\r\nwhen its source is private if the while-condition explicitly specifies it, or when its source is private\r\nand the while-condition specifies it functions in that private zone. Otherwise, a while-static ability is\r\nnot functional.\r\n42\r\nCHAPTER 5. LAYERS, CARDS, & ABILITIES\r\nExample: Heave is a while-static ability that means “While this is in your hand, [...]”, where\r\nthe while condition specifies the source being in a zone that is private by default. This means\r\nthat Heave is functional when its source is private in the player’s hand.\r\nExample: Blood Debt is a while-static ability that means “While this is in your banished zone,\r\n[...]”, where the while-condition specifies the source being in a zone that is public by default.\r\nThis means that Blood Debt is not functional when its source is private in the player’s banished\r\nzone.\r\n5.4.7b A hidden triggered ability is both a while-static ability and triggered-static ability, where the\r\nwhile-condition specifies that the source is private or in a private zone. If the triggered condition is\r\nmet while the ability is functional and the source is private, the owner may decide to trigger the\r\neffect. If they do, the source of the ability becomes public and the triggered effect produces a\r\ntriggered-layer to be added to the stack. The source remains public until the triggered-layer resolves\r\nor otherwise ceases to exist, and then it returns to being private.\r\nExample: The Librarian has the text “While The Librarian is face down in arsenal, at the start\r\nof your turn, you may turn him face up.”, which is a hidden triggered ability that is functional\r\nwhen The Librarian is face down in arsenal and the start of turn event occurs. The player\r\ndecides to trigger the effect, The Librarian becomes public, and when its triggered-layer\r\nresolves it is officially turned face up in the arsenal.\r\n43\r\n6. Effects\r\n6.0. General\r\n6.1. Discrete Effects\r\n6.1.1. A discrete effect is an effect that changes the game state by producing an event (see Section 1.9 -\r\nEvents). Discrete effects have no duration, and after the completion of their event, they have no further\r\ninfluence to the game state.\r\n6.1.2. Discrete effects are atomic. If two or more discrete effects would be generated, they are generated and\r\nproduce their event one at a time.\r\nExample: Sand Sketched Plan has the text “Search your deck for a card, put it into your hand,\r\ndiscard a random card, then shuffle your deck.”, which is a resolution ability that generates four\r\natomic discrete effects: search (Rule 8.5.16), put (Rule 8.5.12), discard (Rule 8.5.5), and shuffle\r\n(Rule 8.5.17). Each effect is generated and produces an event before the next one in order is\r\ngenerated.\r\n6.1.3. If a discrete effect is conditional (see 1.8.3), its condition is evaluated only once, at the time the effect\r\nwould be generated. If the condition is met, the effect is generated - otherwise, it is not.\r\n6.2. Continuous Effects\r\n6.2.1. A continuous effect modifies the state and properties of objects, and/or the rules of the game.\r\nContinuous effects either have a lasting influence effect on the game state, and continue for their\r\nspecified duration, or for as long as their source ability is functional.\r\n6.2.2. A layer-continuous effect is a continuous effect generated by the resolution of a layer. Layer\r\ncontinuous effects typically have a specified duration.\r\n6.2.2a A layer-continuous effect starts as soon it is generated and ends after a specified duration. If no\r\nduration is explicitly specified by the effect, then the layer-continuous effect ends when it is no\r\nlonger applicable.\r\n6.2.2b If a layer-continuous effect has variable values (such as X), the values of those variables are\r\ndetermined when the continuous effect is generated and do not change thereafter. If the effect is a\r\ncontinuous effect that applies to an object that does not yet exist, the variables are determined when\r\nthe effect first applies to an object and do not change thereafter.\r\nExample: Tear Limb from Limb has the text “[...] the next Brute attack action card you play\r\nthis turn gains +X{p}, where X is its base {p}.”, which is a layer-continuous effect where X is\r\ndetermined at the time the effect first starts to apply to an object, not when it is first generated.\r\n6.2.2c If a layer-continuous effect starts to apply to an object, it continues to apply to that object even if\r\nthe properties of that object change.\r\n44\r\nCHAPTER 6. EFFECTS\r\nExample: Primeval Bellow (red) has the text “Your next Brute attack this turn gains +5{p}.”.\r\nIf the player plays and resolves Primeval Bellow, then Pack Hunt (a brute attack); even if the\r\nsupertype brute of Pack Hunt is removed, the effect of Primeval Bellow will still apply to the\r\nPack Hunt.\r\n6.2.2d If a layer-continuous effect is conditional on being generated (see 1.8.3), its condition is\r\nevaluated only once, at the time the effect would be generated. If the condition is met, the effect is\r\ngenerated - otherwise, it is not. If the effect is conditional on being applied, the condition is still\r\nchecked continuously (see Rule 1.8.3c).\r\n6.2.3. A static-continuous effect is a continuous effect generated by a static ability. Static-continuous effects\r\nnever have a specified duration.\r\n6.2.3a A static-continuous effect starts as soon as the static ability that generated it becomes functional\r\nand ends when the static ability becomes non-functional (see Rule 1.7.5).\r\n6.2.3b If a static-continuous effect has variable values (such as X), the value of those variables are\r\ndetermined based on the current game state and are updated if the game state changes.\r\n6.2.3c A static-continuous effect only applies to an object while it has the properties described by the\r\neffect - if the properties of an object change, the static effect may no longer apply to that object.\r\n6.2.3d If a static-continuous effect is conditional on being generated (see 1.8.3), its condition is\r\nevaluated at all times. The effect is generated when the condition is met and ceases to exist when the\r\ncondition is not met.\r\nExample: Luminaris has the text “If there is a yellow card in your pitch zone, Illusionist\r\nattacks you control have go again.”, which is a conditional static-continuous effect that only\r\nexists when there is a card with a yellow color strip in the controlling player’s pitch zone and\r\ndoes not exist otherwise.\r\n6.2.4. If a continuous effect would only apply to a future object that is yet to exist, it starts to apply to the\r\nnext object that meets the specification of the effect.\r\nExample: Come to Fight has the text “The next attack action card you play this turn gains\r\n+3{p}.”, which is a layer-continuous effect that applies to the next attack action card the player\r\nplays after the generation of the effect.\r\n6.2.5. The first time a continuous effect applies to an object, or when a continuous effect changes how it\r\nmodifies an object, it applies as an event which can be modified by replacement effects and trigger\r\ntriggered effects. Each application of a continuous effect is considered a separate event.\r\nExample: Talisman of Featherfoot has the text “When an attack you control gains exactly +1{p}\r\nfrom an effect during the reaction step, [...]”. If an attack has 0 base power and is affected by a\r\n-1{p} continuous effect, then it is affected by a new +2{p} effect during the reaction step, Talisman\r\nof Featherfoot would not trigger because an effect of exactly +1{p} has not been applied during\r\nthe reaction step.\r\n45\r\nCHAPTER 6. EFFECTS\r\n6.3. Continuous Effect Interactions\r\n6.3.1. Continuous effects that modify the rules of the game are applied simultaneously before continuous\r\neffects that modify objects. If there are two or more continuous effects that modify the state and/or\r\nproperties of objects in the game, the effects are applied using the staging system. These effects are\r\ngrouped into stages and are applied in ascending stage order, then if there are two or more effects in the\r\nsame stage, the effects are applied using substage order, then timestamp order.\r\nExample: Hypothermia has the text “Attacks you control can’t gain go again.”, which is a\r\ncontinuous effect that modifies the rules of the game and is applied before any effects would add the\r\ngo again ability to an attack you control.\r\n6.3.2. Stage order is defined by how an effect applies to the object. Effects are grouped into stages and are\r\napplied in ascending stage order. If there are two or more effects in the same stage, the effects are\r\napplied using substage order (see Rule 6.3.3).\r\n• Stage 1: Effects that modify copyable properties are applied. (See Rule 8.5.22)\r\n• Stage 2: Effects that modify or are dependent on the controller are applied.\r\n• Stage 3: Effects that modify or are dependent on name, color strip, or text box are applied.\r\n• Stage 4: Effects that modify or are dependent on types or subtypes are applied.\r\n• Stage 5: Effects that modify or are dependent on supertypes are applied.\r\n• Stage 6: Effects that modify or are dependent on abilities are applied.\r\n• Stage 7: Effects that modify or are dependent on the base values of numeric properties are applied.\r\n• Stage 8: Effects and counters that modify or are dependent on the values of numeric properties are\r\napplied.\r\n6.3.2a An effect is dependent on a stage if the application of another effect in that stage would have\r\nchanged the first application of this effect, and that stage is higher than the stage for this effect. An\r\neffect is independent if it is not dependent on any stages. Dependent effects are applied in the stage\r\non which they are dependent.\r\nExample: Thump has the text “While Thump’s {p} is greater than its base {p}, it has\r\ndominate and ‘When this hits a hero, they discard a card.’ ” which is an effect that is\r\ndependent on the value of the power {p} numerical property (stage 8) and affects the object’s\r\nabilities (stage 6). Because effects in stage 8 can change the application of Thump’s effect, and\r\nstage 8 is higher than stage 6, Thump’s effect is considered dependent and is applied in stage 8\r\n(substage 7).\r\n6.3.2b If an effect is dependent on two or more stages, it is applied at the highest of all those stages.\r\n6.3.2c If separate parts of an effect are applied in different stages, the separate parts of the effect each\r\napply in their respective stages.\r\n6.3.3. Substage order is used if there are two or more effects in the same stage and is defined by the\r\ndependence and type of modification within each stage. For stages 1–6, substage order is used to apply\r\nindependent effects before dependent effects. For stages 7–8, effects are grouped into the following\r\nsubstages and are applied in ascending substage order.\r\n• Substage 1: All effects that add/remove a numerical property to/from the object are applied.\r\n• Substage 2: Independent effects that set the value of a numerical property are applied.\r\n• Substage 3: Independent effects that multiply the value of a numerical property are applied.\r\n46\r\nCHAPTER 6. EFFECTS\r\n• Substage 4: Independent effects that divide the value of a numerical property are applied.\r\n• Substage 5: Independent effects that add to the value of a numerical property are applied.\r\n• Substage 6: Independent effects that subtract from the value of a numerical property are applied.\r\n• Substage 7: Dependent effects are applied.\r\n6.3.3a If there are two or more effects in the same substage, the effects are applied using timestamp\r\norder (see Rule 6.3.4).\r\n6.3.4. Timestamp order is used when there are two or more effects in the same substage and is defined by the\r\ntimestamp of when an effect was first generated. Effects are applied in chronological timestamp order. If\r\nthere are two or more effects with the same timestamp, the order is determined by the turn player.\r\n6.3.4a The timestamp of an effect is the moment it was generated by an ability. Layer-continuous effects\r\nare generated when their source resolves as a layer on the stack (see Rule 6.2.2) and\r\nstatic-continuous effects are generated when the static ability becomes functional (see Rule 6.2.3).\r\n6.3.4b If two or more effects start to apply to an object at the same time the turn player decides the order\r\nthat effects apply. This decided order is only used to determine the order of effects with the same\r\ntimestamps. Once a player has decided the order of effects, the order can not be changed.\r\n6.3.4c When a new effect is applied to an object in a given substage of ordered effects, that effect is\r\nordered after the existing effects in that substage.\r\n6.3.5. Continuous effects are applied dynamically. If a new effect would apply, an effect no longer applies,\r\nor an effect that is already applied is modified, all of the effects are recalculated automatically in stage\r\norder.\r\n6.3.5a If an object is modified by an effect that would make it eligible/ineligible for another effect in\r\nthe current or future stage/substage, that effect is added/removed to the set of effects to be applied in\r\nthat stage/substage.\r\nExample: Minnowism (red) has the text “The next attack action card with 3 or less base {p}\r\nyou play this turn gains +3{p}.”, which is a layer-continuous effect applied in stage 8. If an\r\nattack action card with 6 base power is played, and its base power is reduced to 3 in stage 7, it\r\nbecomes eligible for the application of Minnowism’s effect, which will be added and applied\r\nlater in stage 8.\r\n6.3.5b If an object is modified by an effect that would make it applicable to another effect in a previous\r\nstage/substages, that other effect is not retroactively applied.\r\n6.3.6. Continuous effects that remove a property, or part of a property, from an object do not remove\r\nproperties, or parts of properties, that were added by another effect.\r\nExample: Erase Face has the text “When Erase Face hits a hero, cards and tokens they own lose\r\nall class and talent types until the end of their next turn.”, which removes any existing class and\r\ntalent supertypes of the object, but does not remove or prevent the addition of class and talent\r\nsupertypes gained from other effects, such as Brand with Cinderclaw.\r\n6.3.7. Continuous effects only prevent properties, or parts of properties, from being added, removed, or\r\notherwise modified if they explicitly specify.\r\n47\r\nCHAPTER 6. EFFECTS\r\nExample: Hypothermia has the text “Attacks you control can’t gain go again.”, which prevents\r\neffects from adding the go again ability to the object, but does not remove the go again ability if it\r\nis a base ability of the object.\r\n6.4. Replacement Effects\r\n6.4.1. A replacement effect is a type of continuous effect, or a part of a preceding effect, that replaces an\r\nevent with a modified event. A replacement effect typically specifies the conditions for the event to be\r\nreplaced and the partial or full replacement of the event.\r\n6.4.1a A sub-event is an event that may occur when a replacement effect replaces an event. Sub-events\r\noccur when the event is replaced and before the original event, and may also be replaced by\r\nreplacement effects.\r\nExample: Ward 1 is a replacement effect that destroys its source to prevent 1 damage. The\r\ndestruction of its source is a sub-event that occurs before the event of damage is dealt.\r\n6.4.2. When an event is about to occur that satisfies the condition of a replacement effect, the replacement\r\neffect is considered active for that event.\r\n6.4.3. A replacement effect must exist before an event occurs in order to replace it. If a replacement effect is\r\ngenerated after an event occurs, it does not retroactively replace that event.\r\n6.4.4. A replacement effect can replace an event that has been modified by another replacement effect, as\r\nlong as the effect is active for that modified event.\r\n6.4.5. A replacement effect can only replace an event once per original event. It can not replace its own\r\nmodified event, or any further modified events produced by other replacement effects if it has already\r\nreplaced the event.\r\n6.4.6. If an event is replaced, the event does not occur and the modified event occurs instead. The modified\r\nevent may trigger abilities and cause other replacement effects to be active that the event would not have.\r\n6.4.7. A self-replacement effect is a replacement effect that is either part of a preceding effect generated by\r\nthe same ability or an independent effect that applies to an effect generated by a leading connected\r\nability (see Rule 1.7.7). A self-replacement effect is typically written in the format “[CONDITION],\r\ninstead [MODIFICATION]”, where EFFECT (if any) is the preceding effect the replacement applies to,\r\nCONDITION specifies the replacement condition, and MODIFICATION specifies the partial or full\r\nreplacement of the event created by the preceding effect.\r\nExample: Weave Earth (red) has the text “The next Earth or Elemental attack action card you play\r\nthis turn gains +3{p}. If it’s fused, instead it gains +4{p}.”, which is a layer-continuous and\r\nself-replacement effect. When an Earth or Elemental attack action card is played and is fused, the\r\nself-replacement part of the effect replaces the preceding layer-continuous part of the effect, and\r\nthe card gains +4{p}.\r\n6.4.7a A self-replacement effect does not modify any event other than the event created by the\r\nproceeding effect on its source, or the effect of the leading connected ability.\r\n6.4.8. A identity-replacement effect is a static-continuous replacement effect. Identity-replacement effects\r\nare typically written in the format “As this enters the arena [MODIFICATION]”, or “this enters the arena\r\n(as/with) [MODIFICATION]”, where MODIFICATION describes the modifications to the object as it\r\nenters the arena.\r\n48\r\nCHAPTER 6. EFFECTS\r\n6.4.8a The condition of an identity-replacement effect is its source is moving into the arena.\r\n6.4.8b An identity-replacement effect that modifies the properties of its source defines its copyable\r\nproperties.\r\n6.4.9. A standard-replacement effect is a continuous replacement effect. A standard-replacement effect is\r\ntypically written in the format “(If / The next) [CONDITION], instead [MODIFICATION]”, where\r\nCONDITION specifies the condition for the replacement effect to be active, and MODIFICATION\r\ndescribes the modifications to the effect before it occurs.\r\nNote: Cards printed before 2022 have also used the format “(When / Whenever)\r\n[CONDITION] instead [EFFECT]”.\r\n6.4.10. A prevention effect is a replacement effect that replaces a damage event with a modified event.\r\nPrevention effects are typically written in a format “[CONDITION?] prevent [PREVENTION]”, where\r\nthe CONDITION (if any) specifies the replacement condition, and PREVENTION is the modification\r\nwhich specifies the total amount of damage the effect can prevent, damage type(s) (if any), the protected\r\nobject(s) and/or source(s) of the damage event, and additional modifications to the event (if any).\r\n6.4.10a If a prevention effect is applied to a damage event, for every 1 damage of the given type that\r\nwould be dealt to the protected object from the damage source, the 1 damage is prevented and the\r\nremaining prevention amount of the effect is reduced by 1. If the prevention amount has been\r\nreduced to 0, any remaining damage is dealt as normal.\r\n6.4.10b If the prevention amount is not explicitly specified, the prevention amount is defined as the\r\namount of damage in the damage event.\r\nExample: Feign Death has the text “The next time you would be dealt damage this turn,\r\nprevent it.”, which does not explicitly specify the prevention amount. If the damage event that\r\nFeign Death will apply to is 3 damage, then the prevention amount of this effect is considered\r\nto be 3.\r\n6.4.10c If the prevention damage type is not specified, the prevention applies to any and all damage\r\ntypes. If the prevention damage type is specified, the prevention only applies to that type of damage.\r\n6.4.10d If the source of the damage event is not specified, the prevention applies to all damage that\r\napplies to the specified protected object(s).\r\n6.4.10e If the protected object is not specified, the prevent applies to all damage dealt by the specified\r\nsource(s) of the damage event.\r\n6.4.10f If there are two or more types of damage in the event that the prevention can apply to, and/or\r\ntwo or more protected objects the damage event will deal damage to, the controller of the prevention\r\neffect declares each point of damage the effect will prevent.\r\n6.4.10g If an effect states that a prevention effect can not prevent the damage of an event, the prevention\r\neffect still applies to the event but its prevention amount is not reduced. Any additional\r\nmodifications to the event by the prevention effect still occur.\r\nExample: Spectral Shield has the text “If your hero would be dealt damage, instead destroy\r\nSpectral Shield and prevent 1 damage that source would deal.”, which is a fixed-prevention\r\neffect with an additional modification that destroys the source. If a damage event occurs that\r\ncan not be prevented, Spectral Shield’s prevention effect applies once to the event but does not\r\nreduce the damage dealt and Spectral Shield is still destroyed.\r\n49\r\nCHAPTER 6. EFFECTS\r\nExample: Steadfast has the text “Prevent the next 6 damage that would be dealt to your hero\r\nthis turn by a source of your choice.”, which is an ongoing-prevention effect. If a damage event\r\noccurs that can not be prevented, Steadfast’s prevention effect applies once to the event, but\r\ndoes not reduce the damage dealt and does not have its prevention amount reduced. As such\r\nwill still be able to prevent a total of 6 damage from the source after the event.\r\n6.4.10h A fixed-prevention effect is a prevention effect that prevents a specific amount of damage of an\r\nevent that activates it. Fixed-prevention effects are typically written in the format “[CONDITION],\r\nprevent [PREVENTION]”. After a fixed-prevention effect prevents damage, any remaining\r\nprevention amount is not used to prevent a subsequent damage event.\r\nExample: Dissipation Shield has the text “Instant - Destroy Dissipation Shield: The next time\r\nyour hero would be dealt damage this turn, prevent X damage, where X is the number of steam\r\ncounters on Dissipation Shield.”, which is a fixed-prevention effect that modifies to the next\r\nevent that would deal damage to your hero this turn but does modify any additional damage\r\nevents that turn.\r\n6.4.10i An ongoing-prevention effect is a prevention effect that prevents a specific amount of damage\r\nfrom any number of events that activate it. Ongoing-prevention effects are typically written in the\r\nformat “[CONDITION?] prevent the next [PREVENTION]”. After an ongoing-prevention effect\r\nprevents damage, any remaining prevention amount is used to prevent a future damage event. If the\r\nprevention amount of an ongoing-prevention effect is reduced to zero, the effect ceases to exist.\r\nExample: Bone Head Barrier has the text “Roll a 6 sided die. Prevent the next X damage that\r\nwould be dealt to your hero this turn, where X is the number rolled.”, which is an\r\nongoing-prevention effect that applies to every event that would deal damage to your hero this\r\nturn until X damage has been prevented in total.\r\n6.5. Replacement Effect Interactions\r\n6.5.1. If there are two or more replacement effects that could replace an event with a modified event, then\r\neffects are applied based on an order determined by the turn player and then an order determined by each\r\ncontrolling player.\r\n6.5.2. Select Player: First, the turn player selects a remaining player. When a type of replacement effect is\r\napplied, each player applies their active replacement effects of that type one-by-one until they do not\r\ncontrol any more active replacement effects of that type; starting with the selected player and ending\r\nwhen there are no more active replacement effects of that type to apply.\r\n6.5.2a The turn player does not determine the order of effects they do not control, only the first player to\r\napply replacement effects.\r\n6.5.2b The selected player is determined once per event and does not change.\r\n6.5.3. Self-replacement and Identity-replacement: Second, each player applies any self- or identity\u0002replacement effects they control.\r\n6.5.4. Standard-replacement: Third, each player applies any active standard-replacement effects they control.\r\n6.5.5. Prevention: Fourth, each player applies any active prevention effects they control.\r\n6.5.6. Fifth and finally, the event occurs.\r\n50\r\nCHAPTER 6. EFFECTS\r\n6.6. Triggered Effects\r\n6.6.1. A triggered effect is an effect that can be triggered to put a triggered-layer on the stack. Triggered\r\neffects are typically written in the format “[LIMIT?] (When / Whenever / At / The [ORDINAL] time /\r\nThe next time) [EVENT and/or STATE] [ABILITIES]”. Triggered effects never use the term “instead”\r\n(see Section 6.4 - Replacement Effects).\r\nNote: Cards printed before 2022 have also used the format “If [EVENT and/or STATE]\r\n[ABILITIES]” and “[LIMIT?] effect - (When / Whenever) [EVENT and/or STATE]\r\n[ABILITIES]”.\r\n6.6.1a The LIMIT (if any) specifies the trigger limit, which is the maximum number of times the effect\r\ncan be triggered. If there is no limit, the effect can be triggered any number of times.\r\n6.6.1b The ORDINAL (if any) is one or more ordinal numbers that specify which event(s) within the\r\ngiven duration will match the trigger condition.\r\n6.6.1c The EVENT and/or STATE specifies the event- and/or state-trigger condition that triggers the\r\neffect and creates a triggered-layer. If the triggered condition describes an event (or an event and\r\nstate), the effect is an event-based triggered effect; if the trigger condition describes a game state, the\r\neffect is a state-based triggered effect. The trigger condition is not inclusive of the conditions of any\r\neffects the triggered-layer would generate (see Rule 1.8.3).\r\n6.6.1d The ABILITIES specifies the resolution abilities of the triggered-layer created by the effect.\r\nWhen the triggered-layer resolves, the resolution abilities of the layer generate effects.\r\n6.6.2. An inline-triggered effect is a discrete triggered effect that can only trigger when it is generated.\r\nInline-triggered effects are typically written in the format “When [CONDITION] [EFFECT]”.\r\nExample: Belittle has the text “As an additional cost to play Belittle, you may reveal an attack\r\naction card with 3 or less base {p} from your hand. When you do, search your deck for a card\r\nnamed Minnowism, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your deck.”, where the latter effect\r\nis an inline-triggered effect that is conditional on the payment of the preceding effect-cost.\r\n6.6.2a An inline-triggered effect does not trigger retroactively if the condition is met after the effect is\r\ngenerated.\r\n6.6.3. A delayed-triggered effect is a layer-continuous triggered effect. Delayed triggered effects typically\r\ncontain, but do not start with the phrase “(when / whenever / at / the [ORDINAL] time / the next time)”,\r\nor they start with the phrase “The next time”.\r\nExample: Lead the Charge (blue) has the text “The next time you play an action card with cost\r\n{r}{r} or greater this turn, gain 1 action point.”, which is a delayed-triggered effect that triggers\r\nand creates a triggered-layer when the player plays a card with that cost. When the triggered-layer\r\nresolves the player gains 1 action point.\r\n6.6.3a A delayed triggered effect always specifies its duration, unless it is conditional on a change in\r\nphase (end of turn) or step (combat chain closes), in which case the effect lasts until it is triggered.\r\n6.6.4. A static-triggered effect is a static-continuous triggered effect. Static triggered effects typically start\r\nwith the phrase “[LIMIT?] (When / Whenever)” or “At / The [ORDINAL] time)”.\r\nNote: Cards printed before 2022 have also used the format “[LIMIT] Effect — [EFFECT]”,\r\nwhere LIMIT (if any) specifies the maximum number of times the triggered effect can be\r\ntriggered, and EFFECT specifies the triggered effect of the ability.\r\n51\r\nCHAPTER 6. EFFECTS\r\nExample: Rhinar has the text “When you discard a card with 6 or more {p} during your action\r\nphase, intimidate.”, which is a static-triggered effect that triggers and creates a triggered-layer\r\nwhen you discard a card with 6 or more {p}, and when that triggered-layer resolves, the intimidate\r\neffect is generated.\r\n6.6.5. If a game event or game state meets a triggered effect’s trigger condition, the effect is considered\r\ntriggered. When an effect is triggered, it creates a triggered-layer.\r\n6.6.5a A triggered effect must exist before an event or change in state occurs that satisfies its trigger\r\ncondition, for it to be triggered. If a triggered effect is generated after an event or change in state\r\noccurs that satisfies its trigger condition, it does not retroactively trigger. The exception is inline\u0002triggered effects, which triggers as it is generated if its trigger condition is met.\r\n6.6.5b An event-based triggered effect only triggers if an event that meets the triggered condition\r\noccurs. If the event is modified before it occurs and no longer meets the triggered condition, the\r\neffect does not trigger (see Section 6.4 - Replacement Effects). If the trigger condition also includes\r\na state-trigger condition, that condition must also be met by the game state at the time the event\r\noccurs for the effect to trigger.\r\n6.6.5c A state-based triggered effect only triggers if the game state did not initially meet the trigger\r\ncondition, then changes and meets the trigger condition.\r\n6.6.5d If the trigger condition is proceeded by an ordinal as part of the condition, the effect will only\r\ntrigger on the specified ordinal time(s) the condition is met, relative to the specified duration. If the\r\neffect becomes functional after the specified ordinal time(s) the condition would be met, the effect\r\nwill not trigger for the rest of the specified duration.\r\nExample: If a card has the text “The first time you boost each turn, gain an action point.”, and\r\nit is put into the arena as a permanent after you’ve boosted that turn, it will not trigger the next\r\ntime you boost that turn because the ordinal time “first” is relative to the turn and has already\r\nhappened.\r\n6.6.5e If the triggered effect is triggered, but it would exceed the maximum number of times specified\r\nby the trigger limit (if any), the triggered-layer is not created and will not be added to the stack.\r\n6.6.5f If the triggered effect is triggered, but there is an effect that prevents it from triggering, the\r\ntriggered-layer is not created and will not be added to the stack. However, the triggering still counts\r\ntowards the limit of the effect (if any).\r\nExample: Katsu has the text “The first time an attack action card you control hits each turn,\r\n[...]” and Tripwire Trap has the text ”Hit effects don’t trigger this chain link [...]”. If the\r\nTripwire Trap continuous effect is active and the player that controls Katsu hits with an attack\r\naction card, the Katsu triggered effect will not produce a triggered-layer on the stack because\r\nTripwire Trap continuous effect prevents it. The next time this turn the player that controls\r\nKatsu hits with an attack action card, the Katsu triggered effect will not produce a\r\ntriggered-layer on the stack because the once-per-turn limit has already been reached.\r\n6.6.6. When a triggered-layer is created, it is added to the stack before the next player receives priority as a\r\ngame state process. (See Rule 1.10.2)\r\n52\r\nCHAPTER 6. EFFECTS\r\n6.6.6a When a triggered-layer is added to the stack, the player that controls the effect must declare the\r\nparameters of all abilities of that layer. If the card has any modal resolution abilities, the player must\r\ndeclare the modes for those abilities (see Rule 1.7.6). Then, if any resolution abilities generate\r\neffects that require a target, the player must declare all legal targets for those effects Rule 1.8.4. If\r\nno legal targets can be declared, the triggered-layer ceases to exist and is not added to the stack.\r\n53\r\n7. Combat\r\n7.0. General\r\n7.0.1. Combat is a game state where the combat chain is open and attacks undergo resolution in steps on the\r\nstack and combat chain. The resolution of a chain link consists of seven steps in order: Layer, Attack,\r\nDefend, Reaction, Damage, Resolution, and Link.\r\n7.0.2. An attack is an object that has an attack-target (see Rule 7.0.5) - this includes a card with the attack\r\nsubtype on the stack (see Rule 8.2.3), an attack-proxy on the stack (see Rule 1.6.2), an attack-layer on\r\nthe stack (see Rule 1.6.3), or an attacking object on the combat chain (see Rule 7.2.4).\r\n7.0.3. The combat chain starts the game closed. If the combat chain is closed and an attack is added to the\r\nstack, the combat chain opens and the Layer Step begins immediately. The combat chain remains open\r\nuntil it is closed again (see Rule 7.8.2).\r\n7.0.4. An attack card can not be played, or ability with an attack effect can not be activated, if a rule or effect\r\nwould prevent the player from attacking with that card or ability.\r\n7.0.5. If a player plays an attack card, activates an ability with the attack ability/effect, or adds a\r\ntriggered-layer to the stack with an attack effect, the player must declare an attackable object controlled\r\nby an opponent as the target of the attack (attack-target). (See Rule 5.1.4 and Rule 6.6.6a)\r\n7.0.5a An object is attackable if it is a living object (see Rule 2.5.1), or if it is made attackable by an\r\neffect.\r\nExample: The ability Spectra generates an effect that makes its source a legal target for an\r\nattack, despite it not being a living object.\r\n7.0.5b The target of an attack remains the target of that attack until the combat chain closes. The player\r\ndoes not have to declare the same target as a previous attack on the combat chain and declaring a\r\ndifferent target does not close the combat chain.\r\n7.0.6. When a layer is added to the stack while the combat chain is open, it is considered to be\r\nplayed/activated/triggered on the active chain link (if any), for the purposes of rules and effects. If there\r\nis no active chain link on the combat chain it is not considered to be played/activated/triggered on any\r\nchain link.\r\n7.0.7. During combat, while the combat chain is open, a player can not play cards or activate activated\r\nabilities with the type action, except during the Link Step of combat. (See Section 7.7 - Link Step)\r\n7.0.7a An action card/ability can still be played/activated as an instant during any step of combat when a\r\nplayer has priority.\r\n7.1. Layer Step\r\n7.1.1. The Layer Step is a game state where an attack is unresolved on the stack.\r\n7.1.2. First, the turn player gains priority.\r\n54\r\nCHAPTER 7. COMBAT\r\n7.1.3. Second and finally, when the top layer of the stack is the attack and all players pass in succession, the\r\nLayer Step ends and the Attack Step begins.\r\n7.2. Attack Step\r\n7.2.1. The Attack Step is a game state where an attack resolves and becomes attacking before any defending\r\ncards are declared.\r\n7.2.2. First, if the target of the attack (attack-target) does not exist, or is an illegal target, the Attack Step ends\r\nand the Close Step begins (see Section 7.8 - Close Step).\r\n7.2.3. Second, the resolution abilities of the attack resolve and generate effects, and the attack-source moves\r\nto the combat chain as the active chain link (see Rule 3.5.4). If the attack is an attack-card, the card itself\r\nis the attack-source, and moves to the combat chain as the active chain link. If the attack is an attack\u0002proxy or attack-layer, it ceases to exist and its attack-source becomes the attack instead and moves to the\r\ncombat chain as the active chain link.\r\nNote: Attacks with resolution abilities that generate discrete effects printed before 2021 have\r\nreceived an errata that corrects them to be triggered effects that trigger when the attack\r\nbecomes attacking.\r\n7.2.3a All effects that apply to the attack-proxy or attack-layer, now apply to the attack-source as a\r\nchain link. If the attack was an attack-proxy, the attack-source is considered to have the base\r\nabilities of the attack-proxy. These effects and abilities apply to the attack-source as long as it\r\nremains that chain link on the combat chain.\r\nExample: Sharpen Steel has the text “Your next weapon attack this turn gains +3{p}.”. When\r\na weapon is activated to create an attack-proxy on the stack, Sharpen Steel’s effect begins to\r\napply to the attack-proxy. When the weapon becomes the chain link on the combat chain,\r\nSharpen Steel’s effect that applied to the attack-proxy, now applies to the weapon for that chain\r\nlink only.\r\nExample: Edge of Autumn has the text “Once per Turn Action - {r}: Attack. Go again.”. When\r\na weapon is activated to create an attack-proxy on the stack, it has the base ability ‘go again’.\r\nWhen the weapon becomes the chain link on the combat chain, it is considered to have the base\r\nability ‘go again’ for that chain link only.\r\n7.2.3b An effect that applies to an attack-source specifically as a chain link, only applies to the attack\u0002source while it represents that chain link on the combat chain. If the attack-source becomes a new\r\nchain link on the combat chain, the effect does not apply to the attack-source as the new chain link.\r\nExample: Sharpen Steel has the text “Your next weapon attack this turn gains +3{p}.”. If\r\nSharpen Steel’s effect applies to a weapon as chain link 1, and a new attack-proxy from that\r\nweapon causes the weapon to become chain link 2 of the same combat chain, Sharpen Steel’s\r\neffect does not continue to apply to the weapon as chain link 2.\r\n7.2.3c If the attack-source was a resolved chain link before it becomes the active chain link, the resolved\r\nchain link continues to exist and Last Known Information is used. (See Rule 3.5.4b)\r\n7.2.3d If the attack-source does not exist, or can not move to the combat chain as a chain link, the\r\nAttack Step ends and the Close Step begins (see Section 7.8 - Close Step)\r\n55\r\nCHAPTER 7. COMBAT\r\nExample: Emperor, Dracai of Aesir has the text “Search your deck for Command and\r\nConquer, attack with it, then shuffle.”, where the attack-source is specified as the Command and\r\nConquer. If the search fails to produce a Command and Conquer, the attack-source of the\r\nattack does not exist, so the combat chain closes.\r\n7.2.4. Third, the attack-source is considered to be attacking until it leaves the combat chain. The “attack”\r\nevent occurs and effects that trigger from attacking are triggered.\r\nExample: The attack is Dread Triptych. The abilities “When you attack with Dread Triptych, if\r\nyou’ve played a ‘non-attack’ action card this turn, create a Runechant token.” and “When you\r\nattack with Dread Triptych, if you’ve dealt arcane damage this turn, create a Runechant token.”\r\ntrigger and are added as separate triggered-layers on the stack.\r\nExample: If the player activates an attack ability on an ally object, the ally moves to the chain link\r\nof its attack and becomes an “attacking ally” until its attack resolves.\r\n7.2.4a If the attack-source was attacking on a resolved chain-link, then moves to the active chain link\r\nand becomes attacking, it does so immediately and at no point is considered not attacking.\r\n7.2.4b If the attack-source is a non-living object (see Rule 2.5.1), then the controller of the attack and\r\ntheir hero card become the “attacking hero” until the active chain link resolves, for the purposes of\r\nrules and effects. If an effect of a source on the chain link refers to the attacking hero, it refers to\r\nthat hero until the combat chain closes.\r\n7.2.4c If the attack-target is a hero, that hero and their controller become the “defending hero” until the\r\nactive chain link resolves, for the purposes of rules and effects. If an effect of a source on the chain\r\nlink refers to the defending hero, it refers to that hero until the combat chain closes.\r\nExample: Exude Confidence has the text “If Exude Confidence isn’t defended by a card with\r\nequal or greater {p}, the defending hero can’t play or activate instants or defense reactions\r\nthis combat chain.”, which is an effect that refers to the defending hero of the chain link that\r\nExude Confidence is attacking on. If Exude Confidence is targeting a hero on chain link 1, and\r\nthen an attack on chain link 2 has a different attack-target, Exude Confidence’s effect will still\r\nrefer to the same hero.\r\n7.2.5. Fourth, the turn player gains priority.\r\n7.2.6. Fifth and finally, when the stack is empty and all players pass in succession, the Attack Step ends and\r\nthe Defend Step begins.\r\n7.3. Defend Step\r\n7.3.1. The Defend Step is a game state where defending objects are initially declared.\r\n7.3.2. First, the defending hero (if any) declares any number of non-defense reaction cards from their hand\r\nand/or objects with the type equipment they control. Objects declared this way are considered to be\r\n“defending” on the active chain link. The “defend” event occurs and effects that trigger from defending\r\nare triggered.\r\n7.3.2a If there is no defending hero, then no defending objects are declared. Otherwise, the defending\r\nhero must declare all objects simultaneously, or declare that they are not defending with any objects.\r\n56\r\nCHAPTER 7. COMBAT\r\n7.3.2b The defending hero cannot defend with an object that is already a defending object on a resolved\r\nchain link.\r\n7.3.2c An object must have the defense property to be declared this way (0 is a value). If an object does\r\nnot have the defense property, it can not become defending.\r\n7.3.2d Defending with a card this way is not considered playing the card. It does not incur the cost for\r\nplaying that card, it does not add it as a layer on the stack, nor does it resolve any resolution abilities\r\non that card.\r\n7.3.2e If two or more objects are declared this way, all defending objects are considered to be put onto\r\nthe active chain link simultaneously in a single compound event. The defending hero decides the\r\norder of the defending cards within the compound event for the purposes of effects. (See Rule 1.9.2)\r\nExample: Flic Flak has the text “If the next card you defend with this turn is a card with\r\ncombo, it gains +2 {d} .”, which is a continuous effect that applies to the next card the player\r\ndefends with. If the player declares two cards with the combo ability tag, they select which card\r\nthe effect applies to.\r\n7.3.3. Second, the turn player gains priority.\r\n7.3.4. Third and finally, when the stack is empty and all players pass in succession, the Defend Step ends and\r\nthe Reaction Step begins.\r\n7.4. Reaction Step\r\n7.4.1. The Reaction Step is a game state where players may use reactions related to combat.\r\n7.4.2. First, the turn player gains priority.\r\n7.4.2a The attacking hero (if any) can play/activate attack reaction cards/abilities when they have\r\npriority during the Reaction Step.\r\n7.4.2b The defending hero (if any) can play/activate defense reaction cards/abilities when they have\r\npriority during the Reaction Step.\r\n7.4.2c A defense reaction card/ability cannot be played/activated if a rule or effect would prevent the\r\nplayer from defending with that card/ability.\r\n7.4.2d When a defense reaction card resolves it becomes a defending card and the defending hero is\r\nconsidered to have defended with it. The “defend” event occurs and effects that trigger from\r\ndefending with a card are triggered.\r\n7.4.3. Second and finally, when the stack is empty and all players pass in succession, the Reaction Step ends\r\nand the Damage Step begins.\r\n7.5. Damage Step\r\n7.5.1. The Damage Step is a game state where the physical damage of the active chain link is calculated and\r\napplied. Players do not get priority during the Damage Step.\r\n57\r\nCHAPTER 7. COMBAT\r\n7.5.2. First and only, if the power of the attack is greater than the sum total defense value of defending\r\nobjects on the active chain link, the attack deals {p} damage (physical damage) to the target (if any)\r\nequal to the difference. Then the Damage Step ends and the Resolution Step begins.\r\nExample: If the power of the attack is 6, and there are two defending cards with a defense 3 and 2\r\nrespectively then the sum total defense value of the defending objects is 5. The power of the attack\r\nis greater than the sum total defense, so the target is dealt 6 − 5 = 1 {p} damage.\r\n7.5.2a Dealing {p} damage to the attack target this way, is a hit-event generated by the game (Rule\r\n7.5.3). The source of the damage is the attack.\r\n7.5.2b If the target has ceased to exist or is illegal when the damage is calculated, no damage is dealt,\r\nand the event is not generated.\r\n7.5.3. An attack is considered to have hit if it deals damage to the attack-target during the Damage Step of\r\ncombat. The hit-event is otherwise identical to a deal {p} damage event (see Rule 8.5.3) and only occurs\r\nduring the Damage Step of combat.\r\n7.5.3a If the attack-target loses life as a result of anything except damage dealt by the attack-source by\r\nthe hit-event during the Damage Step of combat, then the attack is not considered to have hit.\r\n7.5.3b If the hit-event is modified by replacement effects such that no damage is dealt by the attack\u0002source to the attack-target, it is no longer a hit-event - the attack is not considered to have hit when\r\nthe event occurs. Damage may still be dealt if the hit-event is modified, but it is not considered a\r\nhit-event if the attack-source does not deal the damage to the attack-target.\r\nExample: Feign Death has the text “The next time you would be dealt damage this turn,\r\nprevent it.”. If the effect from Feign Death prevents all damage dealt by the attack-source, no\r\ndamage is dealt, the hit-event does not occur, and the attack is not considered to have hit.\r\n7.5.3c If a rule or effect prevents a triggered effect from triggering when the attack-source hits and/or\r\nwhen it deals damage, then the triggered effect does not trigger on the hit-event.\r\nExample: Stamp Authority has the text “Attack action card effects do not trigger when they\r\nhit.”, which prevents triggered effects from attack action card triggering on a hit-event. If a\r\ntriggered effect from an attack action card would trigger on damage being dealt (e.g. Blizzard\r\nBolt), and the attack action card hits, the effect will not trigger on the hit-event.\r\n7.6. Resolution Step\r\n7.6.1. The Resolution Step is a game state where the active chain link resolves and becomes a resolved chain\r\nlink.\r\n7.6.2. First, the active chain link becomes a resolved chain link and effects that trigger when the chain link\r\nresolves are triggered.\r\n7.6.3. Second, the turn player gains priority.\r\n7.6.4. Third and finally, when the stack is empty and all players pass in succession, the Resolution Step ends\r\nand the Link Step begins.\r\n58\r\nCHAPTER 7. COMBAT\r\n7.7. Link Step\r\n7.7.1. The Link Step is a game state where the combat can either continue with the chain of attacks or close\r\nthe combat chain.\r\n7.7.2. First, if the attack has go again, its controller gains 1 action point.\r\n7.7.2a If the attack is no longer on the combat chain, the last known information of the attack is used to\r\ndetermine whether the attack has go again.\r\n7.7.3. Second, the turn player gains priority. The turn player may play or activate an attack (see Rule 7.0.2).\r\nIf an attack is added to the stack, the Link Step ends and the Layer Step begins.\r\n7.7.4. Third and finally, when the stack is empty and all players pass in succession, the Link Step ends and\r\nthe Close Step begins.\r\n7.8. Close Step\r\n7.8.1. The Close Step is a game state where the combat chain closes and combat ends. Players do not get\r\npriority during the Close Step.\r\n7.8.2. If a rule or effect causes the combat chain to close, the current step (if any) ends, and the Close Step\r\nimmediately begins. The combat chain closes from the following:\r\n7.8.2a If all players pass in succession when the stack is empty during the Link Step. (See Rule 7.7.4)\r\n7.8.2b If the attack-target does not exist, or is an illegal target, at the beginning of the Attack step. (See\r\nRule 7.2.2)\r\n7.8.2c If the attack-source of the active chain link does not exist or can not move to the combat chain as\r\na chain link (see Rule 7.2.3d), or the attack-source ceases to exist before the chain link resolves (see\r\nRule 7.6.2).\r\nExample: Luminaris has the text “[...] Illusionist auras you control are weapons with 1{p}\r\nand “Once per Turn Action — 0: Attack””. If a Spectral Shield token is activated to attack the\r\nopponent, and the token is destroyed before the Resolution Step, the activated attack will also\r\ncease to exist, and the Close Step will begin.\r\n7.8.2d If an effect closes the combat chain.\r\nExample: The Phantasm and Spectra triggered effects close the combat chain when the\r\ntriggered-layer resolves on the stack.\r\n7.8.3. First, the “combat chain closes” event occurs and effects that trigger from the combat chain closing are\r\ntriggered. All attacks and reactions on the stack, are put into their owner’s graveyard.\r\n7.8.4. Second, layers on the stack resolve, and additional triggered-layers are added as if all players are\r\npassing priority in succession.\r\n7.8.5. Third, when the stack is empty, all permanents remaining on the combat chain return to their\r\nrespective zones - equipment and weapons return to their respective equipped zones. Any other\r\npermanent returns to the permanent zone.\r\n7.8.6. Fourth, all remaining objects on the combat chain are cleared. (See Rule 3.0.12)\r\n59\r\nCHAPTER 7. COMBAT\r\n7.8.7. Fifth and finally, the combat chain closes. Effects that last for “the/this combat chain” end. The Close\r\nStep ends and the Action Phase continues.\r\n60\r\n8. Keywords\r\n8.0. General\r\n8.0.1. A keyword is a reserved term or phrase that serves as a descriptive element for rules and/or effects to\r\nreference or has some rules meaning.\r\n8.0.2. A type/subtype keyword is a keyword used by a card’s text box to describe the type/subtype of an\r\nobject.\r\n8.0.3. An ability keyword is a keyword that substitutes for the rules text of an ability.\r\n8.0.4. A label keyword is a keyword that groups abilities with common effects. A label keyword and its\r\nability are typically written in the format “[KEYWORD] — [ABILITY]”.\r\n8.0.5. An effect keyword is a keyword that substitutes for the rules text of an effect.\r\n8.0.6. A token keyword is a keyword that refers to a specific token. A token keyword is typically written in\r\nthe format “[KEYWORD] token”.\r\n8.1. Type Keywords\r\n8.1.1. Action\r\n8.1.1a A card/activated ability with the type action can only be played/activated when the stack is empty\r\nunless it is played/activated as an instant.\r\n8.1.1b A card/activated ability with the type action cannot be played/activated during combat, except\r\nduring the link step unless it is played/activated as an instant. (See Rule 7.0.7)\r\n8.1.1c A card/activated ability with the type action has the additional asset-cost of one action point to\r\nplay/activate, unless it is played/activated as an instant. (See Rule 5.1.6)\r\n8.1.1d If a card/activated ability with the type action is played as an instant, it retains the type action\r\nand does not gain the type instant.\r\n8.1.2. Attack Reaction\r\n8.1.2a A card or activated ability with the type attack reaction can only be played or activated by a\r\nplayer who controls an attacking hero during the reaction step. (See Section 7.4 - Reaction Step)\r\n8.1.2b When a card with the type attack reaction resolves as a layer on the stack, it is put into the\r\ngraveyard.\r\n8.1.2c An attack reaction card or activated ability is considered to be a reaction card/ability.\r\n8.1.3. Defense Reaction\r\n8.1.3a A card or activated ability with the type defense reaction can only be played or activated by a\r\nplayer who controls a defending hero during the reaction step. (See Section 7.4 - Reaction Step)\r\n61\r\nCHAPTER 8. KEYWORDS\r\n8.1.3b When a card with the type defense reaction resolves as a layer on the stack, it becomes a\r\ndefending card for the active chain link. (See Rule 3.5.4d)\r\n8.1.3c A defense reaction card or activated ability is considered to be a reaction card/ability.\r\n8.1.4. Equipment\r\n8.1.4a A card with the type equipment starts in the game as a permanent if it is selected during the\r\nstart-of-game procedure. If so, it must start the game in the zone that matches its subtype, or in the\r\nWeapon zone if the subtype is off-hand.

A two-handed\r\nobject cannot be equipped if the player does not have two empty weapon zones.\r\n62\r\nCHAPTER 8. KEYWORDS\r\n8.2.3. Attack\r\n8.2.3a A card with subtype attack, is considered an attack for combat. (See Rule 7.0.2)\r\n8.2.3b If a card with the subtype attack is played, the combat chain opens (if it is closed) and the layer\r\nstep of combat begins. (See Section 7.1 - Layer Step)\r\n8.2.4.

Each face of a double-faced card defines the properties of the card as an object in\r\nand outside the game.\r\n9.1.1a A standard double-faced card has a front-face and a back-face, with one of the following printed\r\nsubtypes on their front-face: invocation, or construct.\r\n9.1.2. Each face of a double-faced card has its own set of printed properties.\r\n9.1.2a If a player may look at a double-sided card, they may look at both faces of the card.\r\n9.1.2b If an effect instructs a player to name a card (see Rule 8.5.18), they may name either only one\r\nside of a double-faced card, but not both.\r\n9.1.2c If an effect applies to a double-sided card, it continues to apply to the card even if its properties\r\nare defined by a different face, as long as it does not cease to exist between changing properties.\r\nExample: Oasis Respite has the text “Prevent the next 4 damage that would be dealt to target\r\nhero this turn by a source of your choice.”. If a standard double-faced card with its front-face\r\nactive, is chosen as the source, and then that card resolves, enters the arena, and its back-face\r\nbecomes active, it is still subjected to Oasis Respite’s effect.\r\n9.1.3. Only one face of a standard double-faced card is active at any given point. The properties of a standard\r\ndouble-faced card are defined by its active face.\r\n9.1.3a If a standard double-faced card is outside the game, its front-face is active.\r\n9.1.3b If a standard double-faced card is inside the game, its front-face is active until a rule or effect\r\nwould make its back-face active. If the card would then become a new card, its front-face is active\r\nagain. (See Rule 3.0.9)\r\nExample: Construct Nitro Mechanoid is a front-face of a standard double-faced card. When it\r\nresolves on the stack, its Construct subtype rules that it enters the arena with its back face\r\nactive, turning it into Nitro Mechanoid. If it is destroyed and moves to the graveyard, it\r\nbecomes a Construct Nitro Mechanoid again because its front-face is active.\r\n82\r\nGlossary\r\n(1H)\r\nA subtype of a weapon object that is equipped to a weapon zone.

43\r\nii\r\nPreface\r\nFlesh and BloodTM is a competitive Trading Card Game where two heroes face off in a fight to the death. Each\r\nplayer starts the game with their hero, weapon, and equipment set in play. The battle is fought through the\r\nstrategic use of resources, knowing when to defend, and when to go in for the kill.\r\n“Our mission is to bring people together in the flesh and blood through the common language of\r\nplaying great games.”\r\nThe rules in this document apply to any officially sanctioned tournament of Flesh and Blood and supersede any\r\nprevious version of the rules document for the game. If the information in this document contradicts the\r\nComprehensive Rules of the game, this document takes precedence.\r\niii\r\n1. Tournament Information\r\n1.1. Event and Tournament Types\r\nFlesh and Blood events comprise one or more tournaments. Tournaments are categorized into four tiers and are\r\nrun under three different levels of rules enforcement (see Appendix A - Organized Play Programs). The tier of an\r\nevent is the highest tier of any of its tournaments.\r\nTier 1 and 2 tournaments can be run by any Tournament Organizer who has an active Game Event Manager\r\n(GEM) Tournament Organizer account - some tournaments require an invite from Legend Story Studios (LSS) to\r\nrun. Tier 3 and 4 tournaments are run by LSS or Organized Play (OP) partners appointed by LSS.\r\n1.2. Rules Enforcement Levels\r\nThere are three rules enforcement levels (RELs): Casual, Competitive, and Professional. Each REL has different\r\nexpectations and infractions during the tournament are ruled differently, which can be found in the Procedure and\r\nPenalty Guide.\r\nCasual rules enforcement is designed for local in-store play, with emphasis on player education and enjoyment.\r\nCompetitive rules enforcement is designed for competition, with emphasis on balancing player education and\r\nenjoyment, and tournament integrity.\r\nProfessional rules enforcement is designed for the highest levels of competitive play, with emphasis on\r\ntournament integrity.\r\nMost tournaments are run under a single REL, but some tournaments may have multiple RELs, such as a Calling\r\nthat changes from a competitive to a professional REL between day 1 and day 2+.\r\n1.3. Formats\r\nTournaments comprise one or more formats. There are three categories of tournament formats that Legend Story\r\nStudios supports: constructed, limited, and special. Constructed formats involve players preparing their card-pool\r\nbeforehand and require players to provide their own cards for the format. Limited formats involve the\r\nTournament Organizer providing the materials required for the format. Special formats vary and don’t necessarily\r\nfit into the categories of constructed and limited.\r\nLegend Story Studios currently support the following official formats:\r\nConstructed\r\n• Classic Constructed (7.2)\r\n• Blitz (7.3)\r\nLimited\r\n• Booster Draft (8.4)\r\n• Sealed Deck (8.3)\r\nSpecial\r\n1\r\nCHAPTER 1.

Suspended individuals may\r\nattend and spectate any Flesh and Blood event, but may not be tournament officials at those events.\r\nBanned individuals may not participate in, attend, spectate, or be tournament officials at any Flesh and Blood\r\nevent. If a banned player attends a Flesh and Blood event, they should be asked to leave the venue.\r\n1.5. Player Identification\r\nIndividuals are required to have a GEM profile to participate in a tournament. Any individual may create a GEM\r\nprofile by registering an account on the official Flesh and Blood website. Each GEM profile has a Player ID that\r\nuniquely identifies the individual.

Tournament Logistics\r\n3.1. Round Structure\r\nTournaments are separated into rounds. A round in a tournament typically consists of a match between pairs of\r\nPlayers. If a Player wins a specified number of games in a match, that Player is the winner of that match. Swiss\r\nrounds are rounds of a Swiss-system tournament, where Players participate in each round and are paired based\r\non a combination of Player standings, match history, and the tournament format. Elimination rounds are rounds\r\nof a knockout-style tournament, where Players are eliminated from the tournament if they lose a match (singleelimination) and do not participate in subsequent rounds.\r\nRounds structure and format can vary between tournaments. A tournament is typically a single format with timed\r\nSwiss rounds for all Players followed by untimed single-elimination rounds for the top 8 players in the standings\r\n(referred to as the top-cut or play-off rounds). The number of rounds and round structure recommended/required\r\nfor a tournament is outlined in Appendix B - Number of Swiss Rounds.\r\nFor timed rounds (see Section 3.2 - Timed Rounds), the Players play games until a Player has won a specified\r\nnumber of games or the time in the round expires. For untimed rounds, the Players play games until a Player has\r\nwon a specified number of games. At the end of a match, if a result has not yet been determined, the Players\r\ncomplete the end-of-match procedure to determine the match result (see Section 3.4 - End-of-Match Procedure).\r\nGenerally, only 1 game is required to win a match, unless otherwise announced by the Tournament Organizer\r\nprior to the start of the tournament.\r\n3.2. Timed Rounds\r\nTimed rounds ensure that the tournament proceeds at a reasonable pace and gives Players a good idea of when to\r\nbe ready to find their pairings for the next round.\r\nThe timer for a round should begin when the vast majority of Players are seated or have been given a fair\r\nopportunity to be seated. Players may perform the first game’s start-of-game procedure before the round timer\r\nstarts, but they must wait to begin the first turn of the first game until after the round timer starts.\r\nIf a Judge pauses a match for more than one minute while the round timer is running, the Players in the affected\r\nmatch will be given at least an equal amount of additional time to finish the match. If the match is paused for\r\na regular deck-check (see Section 3.8 - Deck-Checks), the Players will be given additional time to shuffle and\r\npresent their decks again.\r\nFeature matches (see Section 3.11 - Coverage) should be given additional time to compensate players for the time\r\nspent moving and/or setting up, or the feature matches should be timed separately.\r\n3.3. Start-of-Match Procedure\r\nA match officially begins with the players performing the first start-of-game procedure. The start-of-game\r\nprocedure is as described in-depth by the Comprehensive Rules, but simply are as such:\r\nStep 1: Each Player places their hero card face up in their hero zone.\r\nStep 2: A selected Player chooses who the first-turn Player of the game will be.\r\n7\r\nCHAPTER 3. TOURNAMENT LOGISTICS\r\nStep 3: Each Player selects arena-cards from their card-pool with which they will start the game (e.g. equipment\r\nand weapons).\r\nStep 4: Each Player selects the deck-cards from their card-pool that will become their deck (i.e. cards that start\r\nin the deck zone).\r\nStep 5: All other legal cards that are not selected from a Player’s card-pool become that Player’s inventory (see\r\nSection 4.10 - Inventory).\r\nStep 6: Each Player shuffles and then presents their deck to their opponent to be shuffled and/or cut.\r\nStep 7: Each Player reveals and sets up their arena-cards in their respective zones.\r\nStep 8: Each Player draws up to their hero’s intellect. Once both Players have drawn their cards, the game is\r\nconsidered to have begun, and the first-turn Player may begin their turn.\r\nFor Step 2, a Player is selected using a random method (e.g. highest roll, flipping a coin, etc.), and that Player\r\nchooses who has the first turn. If it is the first game of a play-off round, the Player with the higher standing\r\nchooses who has the first turn. If it is not the first game of a match, the Player who lost the previous game of the\r\nmatch is the Player who chooses; or if the previous game ended in a draw, the same Player as the previous game\r\nchooses.\r\nThe maximum time allowed for the start-of-game procedure is 5 minutes for the first game of a match, and 3\r\nminutes for each subsequent game in the match. Players who exceed this time limit have committed slow play\r\n(see Section 5.7 - Slow Play).\r\n3.4. End-of-Match Procedure\r\nAt the end of a match, Players must agree on the results of the match and then submit that result to the\r\nScorekeeper.\r\nFor timed rounds, when the time in the round expires and a winner of the current game is yet to be determined\r\nthe turn player completes their turn, and then 1 additional turn is played. When the additional turn is complete, if\r\na winner of the game has not been determined, the current game is a draw.\r\nFor elimination rounds, where a draw is not an acceptable match result, take the following steps to determine the\r\nwinner of the match.\r\nStep 1: The winner of the match is the Player who has won more games in that match. If neither Player has won\r\nmore games and a game is currently in progress go to Step 2, otherwise go to Step 4.\r\nStep 2: The winner is the Player whose hero has the highest life total in the current game. If neither hero has a\r\nhigher life total go to Step 3.\r\nStep 3: The game continues until one hero has a higher life total and the winner of the match is that hero’s\r\nPlayer. If a game ends in a draw, go to Step 4.\r\nStep 4: Players start a new game with 4 turns total (2 turns per player). After 4 turns go to Step 2.\r\n3.5. Intentional Draws and Concessions\r\nPlayers may intentionally draw games and/or matches by mutual agreement at any time, except for elimination\r\nrounds. Matches in elimination rounds can not be intentionally drawn, and games in elimination rounds can only\r\nbe drawn when there is a stalemate or deadlock.\r\n8\r\nCHAPTER 3. TOURNAMENT LOGISTICS\r\nWhen a Player concedes a game/match, the result is processed as a game/match loss for the conceding player.\r\nA judge should be called when a Player wants to concede. Players may concede games and/or matches at any\r\ntime, except for timed rounds. For timed rounds, Players may concede any time up to and including when time\r\nexpires in the round, but once a Player takes an in-game action after this point, that player may no longer concede\r\nthe match and must play the game to its natural conclusion. If a Player wants to concede after time is called, the\r\nplayer should be dropped from the tournament if there is not a genuine reason why they need to stop playing the\r\ncurrent match. Examples of genuine reasons include but are not limited to:\r\n• There is a personal emergency that requires the attention of the player.\r\n• A player feels physically unwell.\r\n• A player is uncomfortable playing against the opponent.\r\n• A player spills a cup of coffee over themselves and their belongings (only) and they want to concede in\r\norder to clean themselves up.\r\nIf a Player refuses to play a game and/or match, that Player is considered to be conceding the game and/or match.\r\nIf all Players refuse to play a game or match, the match result is a loss for all Players.\r\nPlayers may ask for a concession from their opponent before presenting their deck during the first start-of-game\r\nprocedure (see Section 3.3 - Start-of-Match Procedure). Players may not ask for a concession after they have\r\npresented their deck. Implicitly suggesting or pressuring a Player to concede may be considered to be asking for\r\na concession.\r\nPlayers may not concede in exchange for any kind of consideration (see Section 6.4 - Bribery).\r\nExamples:\r\n• Two players do not want to play a game against each other during the Swiss rounds, but do not want the\r\nresult to affect their personal ranking. They agree to a draw for the match and submit that result.\r\n• It is the last Swiss round for the tournament and two friends are paired. One Player has enough match\r\nwins to make the top 8, so their friend asks them to concede the match before presenting their deck so that\r\nthe friend has better tie-breaker odds.\r\n• Time is called in the round and one Player is in a clearly advantageous position, but can not win in the\r\nnext two rounds. The Player does not ask for a concession, but their opponent decides to concede before\r\ntaking any actions anyway because they want their opponent to have a win, based on the game state.\r\n• Time is called in the round, the Players have already completed the additional turn in the end-of-match\r\nprocedure, and neither Player has won the game. Because neither Player decided to concede between the\r\ntime being called and taking an action, neither Player may concede the game and it must be declared a\r\ndraw.\r\n3.6. Dropping from a Tournament\r\nA Player may drop from a tournament at any time. To drop from the tournament the Player must inform the\r\nScorekeeper. Dropped Players may only be re-entered into a tournament at the discretion of the Head Judge.\r\nPlayers who do not show up to their match are considered to have conceded the match and should be dropped\r\nfrom the tournament unless they inform the Scorekeeper before the next round pairings are generated.\r\nIf a Player drops from a tournament before the first pairings have been generated, they are considered not to have\r\nparticipated in the tournament and will not be listed in the final standings. If a Player drops after pairings for a\r\nround have been generated, they are considered to have conceded that round’s match before being dropped.\r\n9\r\nCHAPTER 3. TOURNAMENT LOGISTICS\r\nIf a Player drops during a limited format portion of a tournament, they own all the cards they correctly and\r\ncurrently have, including any opened, unopened, and partially-drafted booster packs.\r\nIf a Player drops from a tournament early, they may not be eligible for participation prizes at the discretion of the\r\nTournament Organizer. If a Player drops from the tournament after it is announced that they are in the top cut,\r\nthere will not be a replacement for them in the top cut.\r\nPlayers may not drop from a tournament in exchange for any kind of consideration (see Section 6.4 - Bribery).\r\n3.7. Card-Pool Registration\r\nCard-pool registration (referred to as a decklist) is a recorded list of all the cards that a Player may use (see\r\nSection 8.2 - Limited Card-Pool) or intends to use (see Section 7.1 - Constructed Card-Pool). Decklists are\r\nrequired from Players for all competitive and professional REL tournaments. While not required, the Tournament\r\nOrganizer may require decklists for Casual tournaments. For specific decklist requirements, see Appendix E -\r\nCard-Pool Registration Requirements.\r\nWhen a decklist is submitted to a tournament official, the decklist and the information contained therein become\r\nthe property of the Tournament Organizer. Decklists that are illegal, illegible, or not properly formatted may be\r\nrejected. Once a decklist has been accepted, the Player may not alter it. Players are responsible for submitting\r\nall decklists required before the beginning of the first round (for constructed formats), end of deck construction\r\n(for limited formats), or at another time specified by the Tournament Organizer. Players may request to see their\r\ndecklist between matches, which should be honored if logistically possible.\r\nIt is recommended that decklists are kept private to the Player and tournament officials for the duration of the\r\ntournament, with the exception of using it for coverage and providing it to Players in the play-offs at professional\r\nREL. If there are any changes to this, the Tournament Organizer should make it clear before the tournament\r\nbegins. At professional REL, each Player in the play-offs of a constructed format should be provided copies of\r\ntheir opponents’ decklists at the earliest convenience and given sufficient time to review them before the first\r\ngame begins. This is not required for limited-format play-offs.\r\n3.8. Deck-Checks\r\nA deck-check is a procedure to verify a Player’s cards against their accepted decklist (see Section 3.7 - Card-Pool\r\nRegistration). For a regular deck-check, the Player’s cards are collected when a Player has presented their deck\r\nfor a game (before they have drawn their opening hand), and are returned without the guarantee that they are in\r\nthe same order. Regular deck-checks should ensure that the cards are not considered marked (see Section 5.13 -\r\nMarked cards) and that the player has presented cards legally (see Section 3.3 - Start-of-Match Procedure).\r\nRegular deck-checks must be performed at professional REL and are recommended at competitive REL. Regular\r\ndeck-checks may be performed at casual REL at the discretion of the Tournament Organizer. If regular deckchecks are being performed at a tournament, it is recommended that all Players in the play-offs have had regular\r\ndeck-checks during the Swiss rounds of the tournament before they begin the first round of the play-offs.\r\nThe Head Judge reserves the right to perform a (non-regular) deck-check for any Player, including when they\r\nare in the middle of a game or between rounds. If a deck-check is performed in the middle of a game, it must\r\nbe returned to reinstate the game exactly before the deck-check was performed. If a deck-check is performed\r\nbetween rounds the Head Judge should keep in mind that it is not presented as though the Player was about to\r\nplay the game with it; marked cards and presentation errors are typically not applicable.\r\n10\r\nCHAPTER 3. TOURNAMENT LOGISTICS\r\n3.9. Judge Calls and Appeals\r\nA Player may call a Judge at any time during their match. The recommended way to call a Judge involves\r\npausing the game, raising a hand, calling out “Judge!”, and waiting for a Judge to attend the call. At a\r\ncompetitive and professional REL Spectators may not call a Judge, but may discreetly bring a game to the\r\nattention of a Judge if necessary. Judges should attend judge calls guided by the official Comprehensive Rules,\r\nProcedure and Penalty Guide, and Tournament Rules and Policy.\r\nDuring a match, a Player should immediately call a judge when:\r\n• Any Player commits a minor infraction that can not be resolved between the players in a timely manner.\r\n• Any Player commits an infraction that requires a corrective procedure or might create a significant\r\nadvantage/disadvantage for one of the Players.\r\n• There is a dispute between Players that can not be resolved in a timely manner.\r\n• There is an issue or emergency that requires a tournament official.\r\n• The Player needs to leave the table for any reason.\r\n• The Player otherwise needs the immediate oversight of a Judge.\r\nA Player may also call a Judge when they want assisted information (see Section 5.1 - Game Information).\r\nDuring a judge call, Players must answer all questions completely and honestly and may request to do so away\r\nfrom the match.\r\nFor tournaments where there are both Head Judges and Floor Judges, it is preferable that a Floor Judge is the first\r\nresponder to a judge call. If a Floor Judge is not available to respond to a judge call in a reasonable amount of\r\ntime, a Head Judge should be the first responder to the call.\r\nPlayers may not request a specific Judge to attend their judge call or request a different Judge other than the first\r\nattending Judge. If there is an issue with language barriers, Players may request a translator to aide in the judge\r\ncall, which should be honored if logistically possible.\r\nAfter the attending judge has made a ruling, but before the procedure or penalty has been applied, either Player\r\nmay appeal the Judge’s ruling. When a ruling is appealed, a Head Judge attends the judge call to make the final\r\nruling. When a Head Judge is the first responder, the player may still request an appeal, in which case the Head\r\nJudge should consult with another Judge before affirming or modifying their ruling.\r\n3.10. Accessibility\r\nThe Tournament Organizer is responsible for making a reasonable effort to provide an accessible environment for\r\nPlayers to participate in the tournament.\r\nPlayers may request help from tournament officials in regard to accessibility. Exceptions to specific tournament\r\nrules may be made on a case-by-case basis to make the tournament more accessible to individual Players,\r\nprovided the exceptions do not give a strategic advantage to the Player. All exceptions must first be approved by\r\nthe Head Judge.\r\nExamples:\r\n• Assigning a caretaker, friend, or legal guardian to aid a Player with certain tasks like drafting or\r\nshuffling when the Player is physically disabled.\r\n11\r\nCHAPTER 3. TOURNAMENT LOGISTICS\r\n• Assigning a specific play-table for a Player with a physical disability that prevents them from reaching\r\ntheir seat each round.\r\n• Allowing a player to use written phrases made before or during the event, to communicate common\r\naspects of gameplay to their opponent.\r\n• Allowing the use of electronic devices to facilitate translation during a judge call if no translator\r\npersonnel are available.\r\n3.11. Coverage\r\nLSS reserves the right to publish any official tournament information at any time, including during the\r\ntournament. The Tournament Organizer may also publish this information after the tournament is complete. By\r\nparticipating in a tournament, players consent to their tournament information being used for coverage purposes.\r\nThis information includes, but is not limited to, the Players’ names, decklists, and results.\r\nTournaments may have live media coverage, including video coverage of matches by live streaming or replay\r\nbroadcast (feature matches). During feature matches, coverage may direct the gameplay logistics and the use of\r\ntournament materials to improve the quality of the content being recorded and prevent players from gaining a\r\nstrategic advantage. This includes, but is not limited to, using additional markers to visually represent\r\ninformation for the cameras, having the Players wear noise-cancelling headphones, and prohibiting the use of\r\nmaterial that features non-LSS IP.\r\nThe Head Judge may authorize the use of video replays from official media coverage to assist in making rulings\r\nduring a match. Video replays may also be used for the purpose of investigations after a match has been\r\ncompleted.\r\nAt casual and competitive REL, players may decline to be featured during Swiss rounds without penalty. At\r\nprofessional REL, or during play-off rounds at casual and competitive REL, if a player declines to be featured,\r\nthey receive a match loss for the round.\r\nSpectators are permitted to record matches provided that they do so unobtrusively. If a Player or Spectator wants\r\nto use an obtrusive method to record a match, they must request the permission of the Tournament Organizer and\r\nthe Players of the match.\r\n12\r\n4. Tournament Materials\r\n4.1. Player Materials\r\nPlayers are responsible for bringing their own materials required to play the event:\r\n• Physical, visible, and reliable items to record and maintain game information (pen and paper, tokens,\r\ncounters, markers, etc.)\r\n• Materials required for the specific formats and REL of the tournament (assembled decks, decklists, sleeves,\r\netc.)\r\nFor formats where Players are provided cards and tokens to play with, a Player is expected to care for those\r\nmaterials once they possess them. Players are responsible for looking after their own belongings at all times.\r\nDuring a match at competitive and professional REL, Players are expected to keep their registered card in their\r\ncard-pool clearly distinguishable from the other card-like objects. If there are cards stored with their card-pool\r\nthat could conceivably be in the Player’s registered card-pool due to proximity, they are considered part of the\r\nPlayer’s registered card-pool unless they are:\r\n• Cards not the decklist that are promotional cards given out at event.\r\n• Cards on the decklist that have been proxied for the duration of the tournament (see Section 4.3 - Proxy\r\nCards).\r\n• Double-faced cards represented by official placeholder cards in the deck (see Section 4.4 - Placeholder\r\ncards).\r\n• Double-faced cards that are being used represent the back-face of cards in the deck.\r\nThese cards must not be sleeved in a way that they could be confused with actual cards in the registered cardpool. Tokens are not considered part of a player’s card-pool and may be stored with the card-pool even if there\r\nare no registered cards that could ultimately create them. Created cards may be sleeved like registered cards, and\r\nmay be stored with the Player’s registered card-pool.\r\n4.2. Cards\r\nA card is a physical object that represents itself in the game of Flesh and Blood. Players may use any official card\r\nin a tournament. A card is an official Flesh and Blood card if it:\r\n• Is genuine and published by LSS.\r\n• Has a standard Flesh and Blood back-face, has a full-art back-face, is a double-faced card, or is a doublesided token-rarity card.\r\n• Is not a token.\r\nOfficial cards are printed in core sets, expansion sets, supplements, and promotional printings. Artist proofs are\r\nnot official cards.\r\n13\r\nCHAPTER 4. TOURNAMENT MATERIALS\r\nCards may only be included in a Player’s registered card-pool if they are legal in the format being played. Players\r\nare responsible for ensuring their cards are legal for the tournament. If they are unsure, they should ask the Head\r\nJudge. Card legality is defined and managed through the Card Legality Policy.\r\nThe properties of a card are defined by the latest printing of the card, subject to any errata published by LSS.\r\nDouble-sided token-rarity cards\r\nA double-sided token-rarity card (DST) is a card where both sides are the different faces of two unrelated tokenrarity cards and/or tokens. A Player may use only a single side of DST to represent a single card or token in the\r\ngame at a time. If the DST represents a card (not a token) in the game, the Player may not switch the sides of the\r\nDST to represent a different object in the game.\r\nDouble-face cards\r\nDouble-faced cards (DFC) are cards with another card face on the back side instead of the standard Flesh and\r\nBlood back-face. When a player includes a DFC in their deck, it must be in card sleeve with an opaque back.\r\nWhen the card would be flipped to its back-face, the card should be taken out of the sleeve and flipped to its\r\ncorrect orientation. It should be flipped back to its front-face when it leaves the arena.\r\nAlternatively, Players may use an identical DFC with its back-face displayed. This identical DFC must be sleeved\r\ndifferently to ensure that it is not confused with registered cards in the Player’s card-pool. When the front-face\r\nDFC from deck would be flipped, the back-face DFC can be swapped to replace front-face DFC, and vice versa\r\nwhen it leaves the arena.\r\nCreated cards\r\nA created card is a card that is not registered by the Player but is created by a registered card’s effect. If a Player\r\nhas a registered card that creates a deck-card, the Player is responsible for having a reasonable number of those\r\ndeck-cards to be used during the game. If a Player’s created cards are in a public zone they own, they may use a\r\nmarker placed on top of a single created card to represent how many of that card are in that zone, provided that\r\nall the represented cards are otherwise identical.\r\nReprinted cards\r\nA reprinted card (reprint) is a card for which a version has already been printed in a previous product. Reprints\r\nmay feature new art, border, rarity, and even updated properties such as card text. Reprints are legal to play as\r\nsoon as they are available.\r\nNon-English cards\r\nA non-English card is a card that is printed with text translated into a language other than English. A Player may\r\nuse an otherwise-legal non-English card provided it is clear what card it represents and the Player is not using it\r\nto create an advantage, such as by having misleading text or pictures.\r\nMisprinted cards\r\nA misprinted card is card that through a design or printing error, does not accurately represent its intended form.\r\nA Player may use an otherwise-legal misprinted card provided it is clear what card it represents and the Player is\r\nnot using it to create an advantage, such as by having misleading text or pictures. If it’s clear what the misprinted\r\ncard is, but certain printed information on the card is missing or objectively incorrect (such as colour, power,\r\ndefence etc.), the Player is required to have the correct information available that their opponent can refer to and\r\npoint it out when the misprinted card becomes visible to the opponent.\r\nDamaged cards\r\n14\r\nCHAPTER 4. TOURNAMENT MATERIALS\r\nA damaged card is a card that has received physical treatment that ruins its aesthetic quality and/or functionality\r\nas a game piece. A Player may use an otherwise-legal damaged card provided that the damage was due to wear\r\nand tear or is otherwise accidental, and the damage does not cause the card to be unrecognizable, or give strategic\r\nassistance. Intentionally damaged cards, such as cards that have been cut, ripped, or shredded and reconstructed,\r\nare not legal. This does not apply to cards that have been intentionally altered, especially for artistic purposes. If\r\na Player opened a damaged card from limited product, or their card was damaged by an opponent or tournament\r\nofficial, the Player may be issued a proxy (Section 4.3 - Proxy Cards).\r\nAltered cards\r\nAn altered card is a card that has been intentionally physically altered, especially for artistic purposes.\r\nAlterations include, but are not limited to, painting, foiling, collages, printed inner-sleeves, and anything that\r\nintentionally alters the visuals of the card. A Player may use an otherwise-legal altered card provided that any\r\nmodifications do not cause the card to be unrecognizable, contain offensive material, or give strategic assistance.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, altered cards must originally be official Flesh and Blood cards (not proxies); any\r\nartistic modification must not cover or obscure the name, pitch, color bar, or cost of the card; and at least one side\r\nof the card must remain unmodified to allow tournament officials to validate its authenticity.\r\nFor collage-like alterations (e.g. shadowboxing), only arena-cards are can be altered this way. If a Player wants\r\nto use a collage, it must have the represented card as a base/background (with an unmodified back for validation\r\npurposes), or the Player must provide an official unmodified card that their opponent to refer to.\r\nAt professional REL the primary subject(s) of the artwork must not be altered beyond recognition, including\r\ndrastic changes to the silhouette, color scheme, and focus of the primary subject(s) in the artwork. The Head\r\nJudge decides what is an acceptable alter for the tournament.\r\n4.3. Proxy Cards\r\nA proxy card (proxy) is a card that is used to represent an official card in a game. Proxies are not permitted\r\nunless officially issued by the Head Judge of the tournament. The Head Judge may issue a or approve a proxy at\r\ntheir discretion in the following situations:\r\n• A foil card where the foiling is the cause of it being marked in the deck, and there is no non-foil version of\r\nthe card or it would be unreasonable to expect the Player to find a substitute.\r\n• A damaged card where the damage is the cause of it being marked in the deck, and the card was opened\r\nfrom limited product damaged or the damage was caused by the Player’s opponent or a tournament official.\r\n• A token-rarity card at a limited event where there are insufficient official cards.\r\n• A created card where a Player has made a reasonable attempt to supply enough created cards for their\r\ngame but it is not sufficient for the current game-state.\r\n• Printed Ira Welcome decks at a Learn to Play event.\r\nA proxy is used during the tournament to represent an official Flesh and Blood card. The player must have the\r\noriginal card or the information of the original card for the opponent to reference during a game that involves the\r\nproxy.\r\nThe proxy is only legal for the duration of the tournament it is issued. Proxies that have been issued from other\r\ntournaments and self-made proxies are not tournament-legal.\r\n15\r\nCHAPTER 4. TOURNAMENT MATERIALS\r\n4.4. Placeholder cards\r\nA placeholder card (placeholder) is a card that represents another deck-card (typically a double-faced card) while\r\nit is in a private zone. Placeholders are designed so a Player can play with unsleeved double-faced cards or so a\r\nPlayer does not have to unsleeve double-faced cards to use their back-faces.\r\nPlayers may only use official placeholders in place of cards in their deck. To use a placeholder, the player must\r\nensure that the name and pitch of the card it represents are legible; any other modifications must follow the same\r\nrules as altered cards (see Section 4.2 - Cards).\r\nA placeholder card can only be used while the card it represents is in a private zone. While the placeholder card\r\nis in a private zone, the card it represents is not outside of the game. When the placeholder card moves into a\r\npublic zone the player must swap it out with the card it represents (in the correct orientation). If the represented\r\ncard would then go back into a private zone, the placeholder card is swapped in again.\r\nA checklist card is a placeholder that contains a list of cards that the checklist card could possibly represent (with\r\na checkbox next to each card). Each individual checklist card used by a Player must have exactly one card\r\nchecked - the checklist card represents the card that is checked.\r\n4.5. Tokens\r\nTokens are card-like objects that represent tokens within the game. Official tokens are printed similarly to official\r\ncards but have the “token” type printed in the typebox of the card. Tokens are not to be confused with\r\ntoken-rarity cards, which do not have the token type.\r\nThe properties of a token are defined by the latest version of the Comprehensive Rules.\r\nAt competitive and professional REL, if a Player has registered cards that create tokens, they must have the\r\nappropriate physical tokens to represent each of them. If the Player’s cards may create same token but with\r\ndifferent states (e.g. creating a token under each player’s control), they must have an appropriate amount of\r\ntokens to represent each token in those states.\r\nA token should only be present in the arena if it is representing a token that exists in the game. If the Player’s\r\ncards are able to create multiple instances of the same token, they may use a marker placed on top of a single\r\ntoken to represent how many of that token you control provided that all tokens are otherwise identical. Players\r\nmay not start the game with a token in the arena, with the intention of adding a marker when tokens of that type\r\nare actually created in the game.\r\nPlayers may create and use unofficial tokens, as long as it is card-like and the token’s game-related properties are\r\nclearly readable and can’t be confused with another token or card.\r\n4.6. Counters\r\nA counter is a small item that represents a specific type of counter on an object in the game. Players may use any\r\nitem to represent a counter, as long as it is clear what type of counter it represents; does not give the Player\r\nstrategic assistance; is not so small or colored in a way to make that makes it difficult to see; and is not be so\r\nlarge as to obstruct the play-space.\r\nIf two or more counters of the same type are on an object, they must be homogenous and must not be arranged\r\nin a way that makes it difficult to determine how many or what other counters are on the object. Dice and similar\r\ncounting items may be used to represent the number of a specific type of counters on an object, instead of using\r\nan item per counter.\r\n16\r\nCHAPTER 4. TOURNAMENT MATERIALS\r\nExamples:\r\n• A glass bead used to represent a +1{p} counter on a weapon.\r\n• A die to represent the number of steam counters on an item.\r\n• Two distinct dice on an equipment, one grey die to represent the number of -1 {d} counters, and one red\r\ndie to represent the number of energy counters.\r\n4.7. Markers\r\nA marker is a small item that is used to optionally represent part of the state of the game. Markers are not to be\r\nconfused with counters which represent a specific in-game element (see Section 4.6 - Counters). Players may use\r\nany non-card-like item as a marker, as long as it is clear what information it represents; does not give the Player\r\nstrategic assistance; is not so small or colored in a way to make that makes it difficult to see; and is not be so\r\nlarge as to obstruct the play-space.\r\nPlayers may use markers to represent visible or public information in a game, but may not use them to represent\r\ninformation regarding cards in a Players deck or any historical, assisted, or private information (see Section 5.1 -\r\nGame Information and Section 5.8 - Note-Taking). Players may not use markers to represent information\r\nregarding cards in a deck, to avoid the potential abuse of tracking cards. A Player may only temporarily use a\r\nmarker to represent information: once that marker no longer represents the current state of the game the Player\r\nmust update the marker or remove it from use.\r\nIf two or more markers are used to represent the same visible or public, they must be homogenous and must not\r\nbe arranged in a way that makes it difficult to determine the information they represent. Dice and similar\r\ncounting items may be used as markers to represent numerical information.\r\nExamples:\r\n• A resource-shaped marker is used to represent the number of resources a player has.\r\n• A die marker is used to represent the modified power of an attack on the combat chain.\r\n• A metal Go Again marker is used to represent that an attack has go again on the combat chain.\r\n4.8. Dice\r\nIf an action requires the use of dice, any method may be used to simulate the dice roll, as long as the method can\r\nproduce the correct range of possible results and they have an equal chance of occurring. At professional REL,\r\nelectronic devices may not be used to simulate dice rolls.\r\nPhysical dice must have clear readable values, must be weighted to ensure that landing on each possible side has\r\nan equal chance of occurring, and is not so large that they are disruptive when rolled. Dice with similar values\r\ngrouped together (such as spindown dice) may not be used.\r\nWhen physical dice are rolled, they must be rolled from a discernible height and with enough spin to create\r\nsufficiently random results. Dice that leave the playing surface, become ambiguously mixed with other dice, or\r\ndo not come to rest in a stable position on a flat surface, are ignored and re-rolled.\r\nIf the result of a dice roll would have no impact on the game, the Player may skip rolling them. If a Player rolls\r\ntoo many dice at once, they are ignored and the correct number of dice is re-rolled.\r\n17\r\nCHAPTER 4. TOURNAMENT MATERIALS\r\n4.9. Sleeves\r\nA sleeve is a thin flexible card-shaped pocket that protects a card during play.\r\nIf a Player chooses to use card sleeves, all deck-cards used during a game must be sleeved in an identical manner.\r\nAt professional REL, the Head Judge may require all players to use sleeves for their deck-cards. Arena-cards do\r\nnot have to be sleeved identically and may sleeved or placed in heavy plastic cases, so long as they do not\r\nobstruct the game-space.\r\nDouble-faced cards in a Player’s deck must be sleeved in completely opaque sleeves.\r\nAt Competitive and Professional REL, sleeves with highly reflective or holographic patterns are not permitted.\r\nThe Head Judge has the final say on whether any type of sleeve is not allowed to be used in the tournament.\r\nPlayers are responsible for ensuring that their sleeves do not cause their cards to be marked during a tournament\r\n(see Section 5.13 - Marked cards). A Judge may disallow the use of particular card sleeves if they believe that the\r\nsleeves are in a condition or of a design that interferes with shuffling or game play. A Judge may choose to delay\r\nhaving the Player change sleeves until the end of a match.\r\n4.10. Inventory\r\nA Player’s inventory is a group of cards that is a subset of the Player’s registered card-pool but is not being used\r\nin the current game. During the start-of-game procedure for each game (see Section 3.3 - Start-of-Match\r\nProcedure), each Player selects what cards from their card-pool they will start the game with and any remaining\r\ncards become their inventory for the game.\r\nDuring a game, Players may look at their own inventory but not their opponent’s inventory. The inventory must\r\nbe kept completely separate from other cards in the game. Other card-like objects should also be kept separate\r\nfrom the inventory during the game (see Section 4.1 - Player Materials).\r\n4.11. Electronic Devices\r\nAn electronic device is a personal machine capable of recording or presenting strategic notes, communicating\r\nwith other people, or accessing the internet (or a similar network). In general, Players may use electronic devices\r\nduring a match as long as it is not used to gain strategic advice (see Section 5.8 - Note-Taking and Section 5.9\r\n- Outside Assistance). During a match, Electronic devices may be used during the start-of-game-procedure for\r\nstrategic notes, but not for communication.\r\nThe use of an electronic device during a match must be visible to all Players. If a Player wants to use a device\r\nprivately, they must request permission from a Judge.\r\nPhysical records should be preferred over electronic records when resolving discrepancies in a game (e.g. life\r\ntotals).\r\nAt competitive and professional REL, devices may not be used at all during a draft.\r\nAt professional REL, Players may not use any electronic devices during a game.\r\nAdditional restrictions or exceptions to the use of electronic devices are enforced at the discretion of the Head\r\nJudge.\r\n18\r\nCHAPTER 4. TOURNAMENT MATERIALS\r\n4.12. Infringing and Offensive Material\r\nIndividuals may not possess material that infringes the intellectual property rights of LSS, or non-LSS material\r\nthat is offensive, disruptive, or affects the enjoyment of others. If an individual is seen in the possession of such\r\nmaterials, the Tournament Organizer should request that the individual remove the material, or be disqualified (or\r\nfor non-Players, leave the venue).\r\nA detailed policy regarding IP usage rights can be found in the Terms of Use for Game and Studio Assets and IP.\r\nThe Tournament Organizer determines what non-LSS material is acceptable for use throughout the tournament.\r\nExamples:\r\n• Unofficial play-mats with unauthorized use of artwork or logos owned by LSS.\r\n• 3rd-party merchandise with unauthorized use of artwork or logos owned by LSS.\r\n• Counterfeit cards, designed specifically to mimic genuine Flesh and Blood cards.\r\n• Custom card sleeves or play-mats with overly sexualized characters.\r\n• Materials that are racist, homophobic, transphobic, sexist, ableist, or otherwise hateful.\r\n19\r\n5. Gameplay Logistics\r\n5.1. Game Information\r\nThere are five categories of information in a game: Visible, Public, Assisted, Historical, and Private.\r\nVisible information is information about that game state that is physically represented. Players are responsible\r\nfor maintaining the physical representation of cards and tokens they own, counters on those cards and tokens, and\r\ntheir own record of hero life totals. Visible public information consists of:\r\n• State and zones of cards and tokens.\r\n• Printed properties of public cards and tokens.\r\n• Counters on objects.\r\n• Life totals of heroes.\r\nPublic information is information about the game state that is not physically represented. Players are\r\nresponsible for recalling public information about decisions they’ve made, cards and tokens they own, and assets\r\nthey have. Players have a shared responsibility for recalling public information about the shared state of the game\r\nand match. Public information consists of:\r\n• Properties of public objects that differ from their printed properties.\r\n• Details of current public decisions, effects, or events that define the current game state.\r\n• Details of past public decisions, effects, or events that affect the current game state.\r\n• Assets of Players (unspent action and resource points).\r\n• Current turn player, phase of the game, and step of combat.\r\n• The game score of the current match.\r\nAssisted information is information unrelated to the game state. Players are not required to recall assisted\r\ninformation, but it may be requested from a Judge. Assisted information consists of:\r\n• Printed properties of any card or token in Flesh and Blood.\r\n• Game rules.\r\n• Tournament rules and policy.\r\n• Official information regarding the tournament.\r\nHistorical information is information that was previously public information but does not affect the current\r\ngame state. No Player is responsible for recalling this information. Historical information consists of:\r\n• Printed properties of cards that have been revealed but are now private.\r\n• Details of public decisions, effects, or events that do not affect the current game state.\r\n20\r\nCHAPTER 5. GAMEPLAY LOGISTICS\r\nPrivate information is information that is not, or can not be, known by all Players. No player is responsible for\r\nrecalling private information. Private information consists of:\r\n• Printed properties of private cards that have not been seen by all players.\r\n• Details of private decisions, effects, or events.\r\nPlayers are responsible for recalling Visible and Public information, but not for Assisted, Historical, or Private\r\ninformation. Players must answer questions about Visible and Public information completely and honestly. If a\r\nPlayer notices that Visible or Public information is incorrect, they are responsible for pointing it out.\r\nPlayers have the privilege to know Visible, Public, and Assisted information, but not Historical or Private\r\ninformation. Judges must provide any requested Assisted information if logistically possible.\r\nPlayers may not misrepresent (or mislead another Player about) Visible, Public, Assisted, or Historical\r\ninformation.\r\nPlayers may not misrepresent (or mislead another Player that) a type of information is a different type of\r\ninformation.\r\nExamples:\r\n• A Player has a Frost Fang in their hand (private information). They reveal Frost Fang to pay an ice\r\nfusion cost, showing the card to all other Players (visible information). After the reveal, all Players are\r\nresponsible for recalling that an Ice card was revealed to pay the ice fusion cost (public information), but\r\ndo not have to recall exactly what card was revealed (historical information).\r\n• A Player plays Twin Twisters (visible information) and chooses the second mode to get +1p (public\r\ninformation). The opponent calls a judge and asks about the card text of Spinning Wheel Kick (assisted\r\ninformation).\r\n• A Player accidentally drops the cards in their hand (private information). Even if the opponent sees all of\r\nthe cards’ faces this way, it is still considered private information - it does not become public or\r\nhistorical information.\r\n5.2. Shortcuts\r\nA shortcut is an action (or lack of action) taken by Players to skip parts of in-game play without explicitly\r\nacknowledging them. Shortcuts allow Players to efficiently progress a game with a shared understanding of the\r\ngame-state by not having to perform otherwise irrelevant and tedious actions.\r\nA shortcut can only be performed if all Players mutually understand what shortcut is being performed and what\r\nthe game-state will be as a result. The types of shortcuts that can be taken vary between different Players based\r\non their mutual understanding, but the majority of shortcuts involve skipping one or more passes in priority.\r\nShortcuts that involve skipping decisions (other than passing priority) of the opponent must be explicitly\r\nexplained and agreed upon before being performed. Once all Players have acknowledged the final result of the\r\nshortcut, the shortcut has been completed.\r\nPlayers may interrupt a shortcut (including their own), but only if they do so before all Players acknowledge the\r\nresult of the shortcut. They must explain how they want to deviate or at what point they want to respond, in\r\nwhich case the game-state continues from the earliest point of interruption.\r\nPlayers may not use shortcuts to take advantage of poor communication or create ambiguity in the game.\r\n21\r\nCHAPTER 5. GAMEPLAY LOGISTICS\r\nExamples:\r\n• A Player plays a non-attack action card with go again. The Player takes a shortcut to skip all Players\r\npassing priority the and card resolves. Then the Player plays another card.\r\n• A Player controls 5 Runechant tokens and plays an attack action card. The opponent proposes a shortcut\r\nto go to the defend step by saying “I won’t prevent the Runechants”, and the Player accepts. They both\r\nskip passing priority and the opponent takes the damage from the 5 Runechant tokens.\r\n• A Player is targeted by an attack with 3{p}. The Player proposes a shortcut to go to end of the damage\r\nstep by saying “I’ll take the 3 damage” and the opponent accepts. They both skip passing priority and\r\ndeclaring defending cards, and the Player takes the damage.\r\n• A Player has a Fyendal’s Spring Tunic with 2 energy counters on it. The Player takes a shortcut to\r\nresolve the start-of-turn trigger, activate and resolve the ability to gain 1 resource, and play Tome of\r\nFyendal paying 1 resource. They do this by saying “Tunic, paying for Tome”, physically removing the two\r\nexisting counters, and putting Tome of Fyendal into the play-space. They skip putting a counter on the\r\nFyendal’s Spring Tunic in the start phase and passing priority in the action phase.\r\n• A Player plays a non-attack action card with go again. The Player takes a shortcut to skip all Players\r\npassing priority and plays another card. The opponent interrupts the shortcut to skip priority and wants\r\nto play a card in response to the non-attack action card. The game-state continues from the point where\r\nthe non-attack action card is on the stack and the opponent has priority.\r\n• A Player controls Teklo Pistol and Induction Chamber, with 1 steam counter on each of them them. The\r\nPlayer explains that they want to use the verbal shortcut “Pistol for 2, go again” to mean attacking with\r\nTeklo Pistol and activating Induction Chamber, skipping priority and the opponent deciding to defend.\r\nThe opponent declines the use of the shortcut. The Player must now explicitly attack with Teklo Pistol and\r\nwait for the opponent to declare any defending cards before activating Induction Chamber.\r\n5.3. Out-of-Order Play\r\nAn out-of-order play (OOP) is when a Player executes a set of in-game actions that are not strictly sequenced\r\ncorrectly (as defined by the Comprehensive Rules). All in-game actions a Player makes as part of an OOP must\r\nbe legal and the resulting game-state must be correct and clearly understood, as if those actions were performed\r\nin the correct order. Actions in an OOP can not been made based on information that would not have been\r\navailable if the actions were in the correct order.\r\nA Player may ask the acting Player to perform the actions in the correct order so that an action can be responded\r\nto at the appropriate time. If any Player wants to respond during an OOP, the game state continues from the point\r\nwhere the Player wishes to respond and the acting Player is not committed to any pending actions they would\r\nhave otherwise made during the OOP.\r\nA player may not add to, or modify, their OOP based on the reactions of an opponent or the information they\r\nhave gained by making the actions out of order. A Player cannot use an OOP to retroactively take an action they\r\nhave previously missed. In general, a substantial pause indicates that an OOP has been made and completed, and\r\nthat the game-state correctly represents the result of the actions in the OOP.\r\nExamples:\r\n• A Player pitches cards before declaring the card being played or the ability being activated.\r\n• A Player, playing as Briar, plays three non-attack action cards and then creates an Embodiment of\r\nLightning token as a resolution of a trigger from playing the second non-attack action card.\r\n22\r\nCHAPTER 5. GAMEPLAY LOGISTICS\r\n• A Player announces defending cards and a defense reaction at the same time. The attacking player wants\r\nto play an instant in response to the defending cards, so the defense reaction goes back to the Player’s\r\nhand.\r\n• A Player has a Fyendal’s Spring Tunic. At the start of their turn they immediately play a card, pauses,\r\nthen realize that they missed their start-of-turn trigger. The Player can not retroactively resolve the\r\ntrigger, claiming it was an OOP.\r\n• A Player, as an attacking player, asks “Any reactions?” during the reaction step of combat and their\r\nopponent says no. The Player can not record the damage and then retroactively play an attack reaction,\r\nclaiming it was an OOP.\r\n5.4. Reversing Actions\r\nPlayers are expected to consider their options, then take actions intentionally and commit to them. In general,\r\nPlayers are not permitted to reverse a complete action that has been communicated either verbally or\r\nnon-verbally (a.k.a. taksies backsies). Players may not coerce their opponent into allowing them to reverse an\r\naction they have completed. Dexterity errors are not considered actions taken by a Player.\r\nIf a Player realizes they have made the wrong decision for an action they have just taken and wants to make a\r\ndifferent decision, a Judge may allow that player to change their action as long as they have not gained any\r\ninformation since. If the Judge cannot be sure that information was not gained, they should not allow the action\r\nto be reversed.\r\nExamples:\r\n• A Player pitches a card to pay a cost, then before anything else happens they say “Sorry, I meant to pitch\r\nthis card.” A judge determines they have not gained any information and allows the player to take back\r\nthe pitched card, and declare a different card to pitch.\r\n• A Player says “No blocks”, then immediately says “Wait, I’ll block with these cards.” A judge determines\r\nthey have not gained any information and allows the player to take back the defending cards and declare\r\na new set of defending cards.\r\n5.5. Triggered Effects\r\nPlayers are expected to remember the triggered effects they control. Players are not required to acknowledge\r\ntriggered effects they do not control, but may still do so.\r\nA triggered effect is considered to be missed if neither Player acknowledges the trigger, and then its controller\r\ntakes an action or allows an action to be taken, past the point in the game where the triggered effect would\r\nbecome relevant to the game. The point when a triggered layer becomes relevant is different for different triggers,\r\nand if the following criteria are met for the trigger is it not considered missed:\r\n• A triggered effect that requires its controller to make decisions (such as choose targets or modes) must be\r\nacknowledged before the controller next passes priority.\r\n• A triggered effect that affects the rules of the game must be acknowledged before an action is taken, or\r\nacknowledged by stopping an action taken by a player, that otherwise would be made illegal by the\r\ntriggered effect.\r\n• A triggered effect that affects the game state in a visible way upon resolution, or requires any player to\r\nmake decisions upon resolution, must be acknowledged before any player takes an in-game action that\r\ncould only be taken after the triggered effect has resolved.\r\n23\r\nCHAPTER 5. GAMEPLAY LOGISTICS\r\n• A triggered effect that affects the game state in a non-visible way must be acknowledged before it first\r\nvisibly affects the game state.\r\nIf the triggered effect is optional and it is missed, it is considered that the controlling player decided to not apply\r\nthe effect. Intentionally ignoring mandatory triggers is considered cheating (see Section 6.2 - Cheating).\r\n5.6. Game Layout\r\nAt competitive and professional REL, Players must follow the official Flesh and Blood official zone layout. From\r\nthe Player’s perspective:\r\n• The Player’s graveyard, pitched, and banished cards, should be adjacent to their deck and on one side (left\r\nor right) of the play-space, with their equipped head, arms, chest, and legs cards on the opposite side of the\r\nplay-space.\r\n• The Player’s hero and other equipped cards (weapons, off-hands, etc.) should be in the center of the playspace.\r\n• The graveyard should be above the deck, pitched cards towards the center of the play-space from the deck,\r\nand banished cards below the deck.\r\n• An equipped head card should be above an equipped chest card, equipped arms card towards the center of\r\nthe play-space away from the chest, and equipped legs card below their chest.\r\n• Cards on the combat chain should be placed equally between all Players. Cards on a chain link should be\r\ngrouped together, and chain links should be in an ordered sequence from one side of the play-space to the\r\nother.\r\n• Each face-up permanent controlled by the Player should face that player and be on their side of the playspace, above or next to their hero and below cards on the combat chain. They may be turned to represent\r\npublic information.\r\n• Cards and tokens under a permanent should be clearly associated with the permanent they are under.\r\n• Cards and tokens that are not in the game, and cards that are in a Player’s inventory, should be outside of\r\nthe play-space. They should not be placed next to or under other card-like objects in the play-space.\r\nThe official layout can be modified within reason to meet the physical requirements of a Player. If a Player would\r\nlike to deviate from the official game-layout, it must first be approved by a Judge. Tournament officials and\r\ncoverage may enforce and make exceptions to these guidelines in order to keep the representation of the game\r\nclear. The Head Judge is the final authority on what is an acceptable game-layout for the tournament.\r\nThe deck and the combat chain are the only zones in the game where cards (and tokens) are strictly ordered;\r\nPlayers are not required to maintain the order of cards in any other zone. Generally, Players may not intentionally\r\norder cards in the graveyard or banished zone (see Section 5.8 - Note-Taking). Players may have one additional\r\nseparate pile for each of their graveyards and banished zones for cards that are relevant to the current game state.\r\nIf they separate out cards this way, it must be clear what zone these cards are technically in. Players may order\r\nthe cards in these separated zones to ensure clear communication of the game state.\r\nExamples:\r\n• A Player is playing as Fai and has a Phoenix Flame in their graveyard. They may place that Phoenix\r\nFlame in a separate pile from the other cards in their graveyard.\r\n24\r\nCHAPTER 5. GAMEPLAY LOGISTICS\r\n• A Player has cards with a combination of Blood Debt and “You may play this from your banished zone”\r\nin their banished zone. They may place those cards into a separate pile from the other cards in their\r\nbanished zone, and sort them to make it clear what cards have Blood Debt and what cards can be played\r\nfrom the banished zone.\r\n5.7. Slow Play\r\nPlayers are expected to play games at a reasonable pace, to ensure that the match finishes within the round time\r\nlimit and that the tournament can proceed on schedule.\r\nPlayers are encouraged to remind their opponent about playing at a reasonable pace when the opponent is taking\r\nan unreasonably long time to make a decision that progresses the game state. Players may call a Judge to\r\nmoderate the pace of play, which should be honored if logistically possible.\r\nIf a Player exceeds the time limit for the start-of-game procedure (see Section 3.3 - Start-of-Match Procedure),\r\nthey have committed slow play and should be issued the appropriate penalty.\r\nIntentionally playing slowly is considered Stalling (see Section 6.6 - Stalling).\r\n5.8. Note-Taking\r\nNote-taking is a broad term that refers to the use of aids to record information relating to the game. In general,\r\nPlayers may not take notes during games.\r\nPlayers may take notes between games and Spectators may take notes at any time, but those notes may not be\r\nreferred to during a game (see Section 5.9 - Outside Assistance).\r\nPlayers may record hero life totals and changes to hero life totals (see Section 5.1 - Game Information) in order\r\nto maintain the correct game state. Additionally, markers may be used to temporarily represent visible or public\r\ninformation (except information concerning a Player’s deck), but they must be updated or removed when they no\r\nlonger represent that information (see Section 5.1 - Game Information and Section 4.7 - Markers).\r\nAny acceptable forms of note-taking must be clear, accurate, and available to all Players and judges. Acceptable\r\nnote-taking during a game includes, but is not limited to, the following:\r\nExamples:\r\n• Recording meta-game information, between rounds such as the opponent’s name and hero, who went first,\r\nand the winner of the game.\r\n• Using a marker to represent the current turn-player, phase of the turn, or step of combat.\r\n• Recording the life total, changes to the life total, and the source of the change (i.e. the source of the\r\ndamage or effect).\r\n• Using markers or dice, to represent remaining resource and action points.\r\n• Turning permanents sideways or placing markers on them, to represent the use of activated abilities or\r\ntriggered effects for the turn.\r\n• Using dice to represent the power of an attack or the damage of an effect.\r\n• Using dice to represent the number of specific cards in a public zone. (e.g. blood debt)\r\n• Using markers to represent gained abilities or effects (e.g. Go again).\r\n• Writing down, using dice, or using markers to represent the value of X for effects.\r\n25\r\nCHAPTER 5. GAMEPLAY LOGISTICS\r\n• Recording a card named by a player due to a card effect (e.g. Chain of Eminence).\r\nAll other forms of note-taking during a game are not permitted, including recording assisted, historical or private\r\ninformation, and misleading or misrepresented visible and public information. Unacceptable note-taking during a\r\ngame includes but is not limited to the following:\r\nExamples:\r\n• Using a dice or marker to record the current turn number.\r\n• Recording the order of cards that you or your opponent pitch.\r\n• Recording opponent’s cards that are revealed from effects.\r\n• Recording cards that have been played by you or your opponent.\r\n• Intentionally ordering your graveyard or banished cards to determine what is in your deck (except cards\r\nthat are relevant to the game state).\r\n• Calculating numbers or future game-states by writing them down.\r\n• Using dice to track how many cards you or your opponent has drawn.\r\n• Using dice to represent how many cards are in your deck.\r\n• Placing markers on your deck to remind you of start-of-turn triggered effects.\r\n• Using a life pad with incorrectly labelled columns for the Player and their opponent.\r\n• Leaving a dice above the pitch zone that no longer represents the number of resources a Player has.\r\n5.9. Outside Assistance\r\nDuring a match, draft, or when otherwise directed by the Tournament Organizer or Head Judge, Players may not\r\nseek advice from a Spectator or refer to personal notes made before or during the event, and Spectators may not\r\ngive play advice to a Player. However, Players may take and refer to personal notes during the start-of-game\r\nprocedure before each game (e.g. sideboard guides). Electronic devices may also be used during the\r\nstart-of-game procedure, as long as they are not used to gain or seek advice from a Spectator.\r\nPlayers may be assisted by Spectators, notes, or electronic devices in order to make the tournament accessible for\r\nthem (see Section 3.10 - Accessibility).\r\nAt competitive and professional REL, Players and Spectators are expected to remain silent during a draft.\r\n5.10. Card Identification and Interpretation\r\nA player may identify a card by name (or name and pitch), or they may provide a description or partial name that\r\ncould only reasonably apply to one card (or card cycle in some cases). If a Player or Judge thinks the description\r\nor partial name is ambiguous, they must request further clarification before they assist with providing card\r\ninformation.\r\nThe official text for any card is the English text of the latest printing of that card, subject to any errata published.\r\nPlayers have the right to request the official text, which should be honored if logistically possible. Players may\r\nnot use errors in the official card text to abuse the rules. The Head Judge is the final authority for card\r\ninterpretations and may overrule official card text if an error is discovered.\r\n26\r\nCHAPTER 5. GAMEPLAY LOGISTICS\r\n5.11. Card Shuffling\r\nShuffling means sufficiently randomizing a set of cards so that it is in a state where no Player has any information\r\nregarding the order of the cards in the set.\r\nPlayers’ decks must be shuffled at the start of every game and whenever instructed to do so. After a Player has\r\nshuffled their deck, they must present it to their opponent. It is recommended that the opponent cuts the present\r\ndeck, but they may also shuffle it themselves. If an opponent does not believe the Player has sufficiently shuffled\r\ntheir deck before presenting, the opponent should call a Judge.\r\nThere are numerous ways to shuffle a deck. It is recommended that players use multiple riffle and overhand\r\nshuffles, followed by a cut, to get a sufficiently randomized deck. Pile counting and other deterministic forms of\r\nshuffling are not acceptable methods alone to shuffle a deck. Players are expected to be able to shuffle their deck\r\nsufficiently and in an efficient manner.\r\nIf a Player had the opportunity to see the faces of any of the cards being shuffled, the deck is not considered\r\nrandomized and must be shuffled again.\r\n5.12. Random Values\r\nFor simply determining random values by rolling dice, see Section 4.8 - Dice.\r\nIf a Player is instructed to select one or more random cards from a set of cards, the Player should use dice to\r\nselect those cards at random (see Section 4.8 - Dice). To do so, the Player must announce what values of the dice\r\ncorrespond to what cards in the set before they roll the dice. If the possible values of the dice (or equivalent) do\r\nnot equal the number of possible cards in the set, the player may, within reason, assign certain values to indicate a\r\nreroll of the dice. In all cases, all cards must have an equal likelihood of being randomly selected.\r\nIf no cards in the set are considered marked when they are face-down (see Section 5.13 - Marked cards), the\r\nPlayer may instead shuffle the set and have an opponent choose the card(s) while they are face-down.\r\n5.13. Marked cards\r\nA card, or set of cards, is considered marked if it is distinguishable from other cards without being able to see\r\nthe front of the cards. Players are responsible for ensuring that all of their deck-cards are not marked during a\r\ntournament. Players may alert a judge if they suspect their opponent’s cards are marked in a way that would give\r\nthat player an advantage.\r\nIf the cards are sleeved, this distinction is based on whether the cards are distinguishable while they are in those\r\nsleeves. It is recommended that players exercise care when sleeving cards, and that they shuffle the sleeves or\r\ncards prior to sleeving to reduce the likelihood of creating a pattern. Players should be mindful that sleeves may\r\nrequire replacement throughout a tournament as they become worn from use.\r\nThe Head Judge determines which, if any, cards are marked. If an issue has been found, Judges may request that\r\na Player sleeve/resleeve their deck immediately or before the beginning of the next round.\r\nExamples:\r\n• A player has reversed the orientation of one or more cards in their deck.\r\n• A player has a deck of otherwise flat non-foil cards, but one is significantly curled making it a marked\r\ncard.\r\n• A player has a deck of otherwise slightly curled foil cards, but one is completely flat making it a marked\r\ncard.\r\n27\r\nCHAPTER 5. GAMEPLAY LOGISTICS\r\n• A player has an unsleeved deck and one of the cards is slightly bent.\r\n• A player has used the same type of sleeves, but from two packs: one with a lighter hue.\r\n• A player has sleeves where some of the corners are folded over from wear and tear from shuffling.\r\n• A player has sleeves with art on the back and some of the sleeves have art that is misprinted or\r\nmisaligned.\r\n28\r\n6. Behaviour and Conduct\r\n6.1. Sporting Conduct\r\nPlayers are expected to behave in a respectful manner to anyone in the tournament area. While Players are not\r\nrequired to show sporting behaviour, they should not behave in an unsporting manner.\r\nGenerally, unsporting conduct includes displays of negative, offensive, or disruptive behaviour that affects the\r\nsafety or enjoyment of others, and/or negatively affects the integrity or organization of the event. The Head Judge\r\ndetermines what constitutes unsporting conduct.\r\nExamples:\r\n• A Player uses offensive language around others.\r\n• A Player shoves others while moving through crowds.\r\n• A player takes photos of another person with malicious intent.\r\n• A Player ignores the instruction of a Judge (a player may appeal a ruling before following the\r\ninstruction).\r\n• A player refuses to follow the instruction of the Tournament Organizer or Head Judge.\r\n6.2. Cheating\r\nPlayers are expected to abide by the rules of the game and tournament and cooperate with tournament officials to\r\nthe best of their knowledge and ability. Cheating is when a player intentionally breaks these rules, ignores\r\nsomeone breaking these rules, or lies to a tournament official, in order to gain an advantage in the tournament.\r\n6.3. Aggressive and Disruptive Behaviour\r\nEveryone should feel safe in a tournament environment.\r\nAggressive behavior involves physical harm or the threat of physical harm that compromises the safety of\r\nindividuals at the tournament. There is no tolerance for physical abuse or intimidation at any event. Items and/or\r\nweapons that are offensive or dangerous to the safety of other individuals are strictly prohibited from all Flesh\r\nand Blood events.\r\nIndividuals who disrupt the running of the tournament, create an unwelcoming or unpleasant atmosphere, who\r\nabuse, insult, harass, or negatively impact another individual’s tournament experience, may be asked to leave the\r\nvenue by the Tournament Organizer. In addition, individuals may not be under the influence of alcohol or\r\nrecreational drugs.\r\nIndividuals that attend a Flesh and Blood event are expected to have an acceptable level of hygiene. If a person\r\ndoes not meet the basic requirements of acceptable hygiene, they may be asked to resolve the issue or leave the\r\nvenue.\r\n6.4. Bribery\r\nPlayers may not offer or accept a reward or other incentive in exchange for determining the result of a game or\r\nmatch, for dropping from the tournament, or for influencing an in-game decision.\r\n29\r\nCHAPTER 6. BEHAVIOUR AND CONDUCT\r\nPlayers may offer and accept a prize split with their opponent provided it does not influence the result of the\r\ngame or match. A prize split does not have to be equal in value. Prize splits are facilitated by the Players\r\nthemselves and tournament officials are not required to ensure that the prize split actually occurs.\r\nExamples:\r\n• Offering to concede in exchange for a concession in the future is considered bribery.\r\n• Offering money in exchange for a match win is considered bribery.\r\n• Offering favors to a player or official to induce an action they otherwise would not do is considered\r\nbribery.\r\n6.5. Wagering\r\nIndividuals may not wager, ante, or bet on any portion or result of a game, match, or tournament.\r\nExamples:\r\n• Players of a match agree that the loser has to pay for dinner.\r\n• Two players agree to bet 20 on which of them will end up ranked higher in the final standings.\r\n• A group of players start a betting pool on who will win the top 8 of a tournament.\r\n6.6. Stalling\r\nPlayers must not intentionally play at a pace that avoids completing a game before the round time expires, or\r\ndisrupts tournament organization.\r\nExamples:\r\n• A Player intentionally takes as long as possible make decisions near the end of the round, so that they get\r\na draw instead of loss for the match.\r\n• A Player continuously makes judge calls to get as many and as large a time extensions as possible and\r\ndelay the start of the next tournament round.\r\n6.7. Buying, Selling, and Trading Cards\r\nIndividuals are expected to follow the floor rules regarding buying, selling, and trading products and services.\r\nIf the event is held in a local game store, the store sets the rules regarding buy, sell, or trade activity. If the event\r\nis held in a public venue, the Tournament Organizer sets the rules regarding buy, sell, or trade activity.\r\nAt events run by LSS, or LSS partners, individuals may buy, sell, and trade Flesh and Blood single cards in the\r\nvenue, unless otherwise stated in the event information published by LSS. Buying and/or selling goods or\r\nservices other than Flesh and Blood single cards at the event venue without permission from a LSS is strictly\r\nprohibited. Individuals caught buying or selling goods this way may be asked to leave the venue and/or subject to\r\nfurther penalties.\r\n30\r\n7. Constructed Formats\r\n7.1. Constructed Card-Pool\r\nPlayers may only play with cards in their card-pool, subject to the class and/or talents of their hero, keywords,\r\nand format-specific restrictions. A Player’s card-pool contains cards exactly the cards they supply (and register)\r\nfor the constructed format.\r\n7.2. Classic Constructed Format\r\nA Player’s classic constructed card-pool comprises 1 non-young hero card and a combined total of 80 arena-cards\r\nand deck-cards. A card can only be included in a Player’s card-pool if the card’s class/talents are a subset of the\r\nhero’s class/talents. A card-pool may contain up to 3 copies of each unique card.\r\nA Player must start the game with a minimum of 60 cards in their deck.\r\nThese specifications are subject to any meta-static abilities of the cards in the card-pool (e.g. Legendary).\r\n7.3. Blitz Format\r\nA Player’s blitz card-pool comprises 1 young hero card, 11 arena-cards, and 40 deck-cards. A card can only be\r\nincluded in a Player’s card-pool if the card’s class/talents are a subset of the hero’s class/talents. A card-pool may\r\ncontain up to 2 copies of each unique card.\r\nA Player must start the game with exactly 40 cards in their deck.\r\nThese specifications are subject to any meta-static abilities of the cards in the card-pool (e.g. Legendary).\r\n31\r\n8. Limited Formats\r\n8.1. Limited Product\r\nProduct for a limited format must be received directly from tournament officials, and must only be used for that\r\nformat. This product must be previously unopened.\r\nAt the discretion of LSS, packs may be opened in advanced to be stamped. For draft product, DFCs should be\r\nreplaced by an appropriate placeholder card indicating the correct DFC (see Section 4.4 - Placeholder cards).\r\nPlayers that have drafted placeholder cards should be given the DFC it represented after the draft has concluded,\r\nbut before the beginning of the first round of the format.\r\nIf the Tournament Organizer allows Players to provide their own product, that product should be pooled with the\r\nrest of the product for the format before being randomly distributed.\r\nIf the product does not contain enough token-rarity cards for limited play, the Tournament Organizer is\r\nresponsible for to provide the additional cards or appropriate substitutes (see Section 4.3 - Proxy Cards). The\r\nTournament Organizer may require that any token-rarity cards supplied are returned at the end of the format.\r\nPlayers may use their own cards in place of token-rarity cards, as long as they are the same unique card.\r\n8.2. Limited Card-Pool\r\nPlayers may only play with cards in their limited card-pool, subject to the class and/or talents of their hero,\r\nkeywords, and format-specific restrictions. A Player’s limited card-pool contains cards from the product they\r\nhave received and any number of token-rarity cards from the product being used for the format. A Player does\r\nnot have to open token-rarity cards from the product for it to be added to their card-pool (see Section 8.1 -\r\nLimited Product). Token-rarity cards are typically heroes and weapons, but may also include equipment and\r\ndeck-cards.\r\n“Cracked Bauble” is token-rarity yellow Gem Resource card with no other properties; it is printed specifically to\r\nsupport limited play. As with other token-rarity cards, Players may add any number of Cracked Bauble to their\r\ncard-pool, but this is only recommended if the Player cannot construct a 30-card minimum deck otherwise.\r\nPlayers must play as a young hero from the product being used for the format. If card-pool registration is\r\nrequired (see Section 3.7 - Card-Pool Registration), Players must choose and register the hero they will play\r\nbefore the end of deck construction, and must play as that hero for the entire format. If card-pool registration is\r\nnot required, Players may change heroes between games.\r\nA limited format deck may contain any number of copies of each unique card with the following limitations for\r\neach product:\r\nUprising Maximum of 3 Phoenix Flame cards\r\nA Player must start the game with a minimum of 30 cards in their deck. There is no maximum deck size.\r\nThese specifications are subject to any meta-static abilities of the cards in the card-pool (e.g. Legendary).\r\n32\r\nCHAPTER 8. LIMITED FORMATS\r\n8.3. Sealed Deck Format\r\nFor the sealed deck limited format, Players are given booster packs and the cards that they open from these\r\nbooster packs become the Player’s card-pool. It is recommended that each player is given 6 booster packs from\r\nthe same set and that the set is designed to support limited play.\r\nIf card-pool registration is required, players must complete their card-pool registration before they are given time\r\nto construct their decks. The recommended card-pool registration process for the sealed deck format is as\r\nfollows:\r\nOpen and observe (5 minutes)\r\n• Players are assigned alphabetical or random seating, so that each Player is sitting across from another\r\nPlayer. The Players on one side are Side A and the others are Side B. A Judge may be seated in front of a\r\nPlayer if there is an odd number of total Players.\r\n• Each Player is given their sealed product, but does not open them yet.\r\n• Each Player fills out their information as the “player using pool” on their registration sheet.\r\n• Each Player on Side A opens their sealed product one booster pack at a time, removes the token-rarity\r\ncard(s), and counts out the remaining cards face-up while the Player on Side B observes. When all of the\r\nproduct on Side A is open, the cards are stacked in a single pile in front of the Player. Repeat with Side B\r\nopening and Side A observing. The card-pool of each Player (minus token-rarity cards) should be a single\r\npile in front of them.\r\nSwap, register, and swap (20 minutes)\r\n• Players on each side exchange their card-pool and registration sheet.\r\n• Each Player fills out their information as the “player registering pool” on the registration sheet they have\r\nreceived.\r\n• Each Player sorts the received card-pool by class/talent, then by name and pitch. Then each Player registers\r\nevery card in the card-pool onto received registration sheet.\r\n• The players return the card-pool and registration sheet back to their original side.\r\nValidate (5 minutes)\r\n• Each Player validates their sorted card-pool against their registration sheet.\r\n• If a Player spots a mistake on their registration sheet, the Player must call a Judge to review and sign-off\r\nany corrections required.\r\n8.4. Booster Draft Format\r\nFor the booster draft limited format, Players are arranged into pods and are given boosters packs. During the\r\ndrafting process, Players take (draft) one card from a booster pack and then pass the remaining cards along until\r\nall of the cards have been drafted. The cards that they draft from these booster packs become the Player’s\r\ncard-pool. It is recommended that each player is given 3 booster packs from the same set and that the set is\r\ndesigned to support limited play.\r\nFor all rounds of a single booster draft format, Players should only play against other Players within the same\r\ndraft pod.\r\n33\r\nCHAPTER 8. LIMITED FORMATS\r\nThe recommended draft procedure is as follows:\r\n• Players are allocated into draft pods and are seated in a circular formation. The recommended number of\r\nplayers in a draft pod is 8.\r\n• Each Player is given their draft product, but does not open them yet.\r\n• Each Player in the pod opens one of the draft product booster packs and removes the token-rarity card(s).\r\n• Each Player drafts one card, places it face-down in a single pile in front of them, then shuffles the\r\nremaining cards and passes them to the Player on their left. Players pick up the cards passed to them and\r\nrepeat this process until all of the cards have been drafted this way.\r\n• Between drafting each booster pack, Players may review all of the cards they have drafted, before returning\r\nthem to a single face-down pile.\r\n• Players repeat the opening, drafting, and reviewing process with the remaining product, alternating the\r\ndirection that the remaining cards are passed; the first pack to their left, the second pack to their right, and\r\nthe third pack to their left.\r\n• After all of the product has been drafted, the card-pool of each Player (minus token-rarity cards) should be\r\na single pile in front of them.\r\nDuring the draft procedure, Players may not share or seek to gain information about the content of the packs, or\r\nthe cards that have been drafted. For the avoidance of doubt, Players may not communicate in any way that could\r\ninfluence players participating in the draft.\r\nExamples:\r\n• Looking at the cards another player is drafting or has drafted.\r\n• Saying “Sigh, no good Guardian cards this pack.”\r\n• Saying “Wow, a Ninja legendary! Guess what I’m picking.”\r\n• Saying “Looks like I’m drafting my favourite hero again.”\r\n• Turning cards upside down in a pack before passing it.\r\nIf the product contains one or more DFCs (see Section 4.4 - Placeholder cards), Players may not share or seek to\r\ngain information about who has a DFC in their current pack or who has drafted a DFC (including themselves).\r\nInstead, Players may start with a token in their face-down pile and when a player drafts a DFC, they must do so\r\nby putting it under another card in their face-down pile, to prevent it from being the top card of their pile.\r\nWhen a Player drafts a card and places it face-down in their pile, their choice is finalized and the cards may not\r\nbe swapped with another card from the pack.\r\nPlayers may not look at the face-down pile of cards they have drafted while the drafting of cards is in progress.\r\nThey must wait for the review period between drafting booster packs.\r\nA called draft, is when the draft procedure is timed and each step is synchronized by a “draft caller”. At\r\nProfessional REL, all booster drafts are called. At Competitive REL, booster drafts are called only if required by\r\nLSS or at the discretion of the Tournament Organizer and announced in advance. At Casual REL no booster\r\ndrafts are called.\r\nIf the draft is called, the recommended draft times can be found in Appendix C - Time Limits. If the tournament\r\nwould differ from the recommended time limit, it must be clearly stated before the draft begins and can not be\r\nchanged mid-draft.\r\n34\r\nCHAPTER 8. LIMITED FORMATS\r\nIf the draft is not called, Players should draft and pass cards at a comfortable pace that does not adversely affect\r\nthe overall pace of the draft for other players at the table or extend the draft indefinitely.\r\nIf card-pool registration is required, players must complete their card-pool registration before they are given time\r\nto construct their decks. The recommended card-pool registration process for the sealed deck format is as\r\nfollows:\r\nRegistration (15 minutes)\r\n• Players start seated with their face-down pile of cards as their card-pool.\r\n• Each Player is given a registration sheet, and is assigned a new seating area where they are not in proximity\r\nto other Players in their draft pod (they do not move yet).\r\n• Each Player puts their card-pool into a clear zip-lock bag or folds their registration sheet over their cardpool to produce a small package of cards.\r\n• Each Player moves to their new assigned seating. Players must not communicate or exchange cards in their\r\ncard-pool while moving.\r\n• Each Player registers every card in the card-pool onto their registration sheet, then calls a tournament\r\nofficial to collect their sheet.\r\n• After the registration sheet has been collected, Players are free to leave the seated area.\r\n35\r\n9. Special Formats\r\n9.1. Deck Construction\r\nDeck construction for special formats vary by each format. See each format for the requirements and restrictions\r\nthat apply.\r\n9.2.

The rounds\r\nare calculated to ensure that, with typical match results, there is one undefeated Player and all Players with an\r\nX-1 record (or better) will be in a top 8 play-off. If the number of Swiss rounds differ from the table, the\r\nTournament Organizer is required to inform players at the time of registration or it must be clearly stated in event\r\nadvertising.\r\nPremier tournaments and multi-format tournaments may have different structures, in which case refer to the fact\r\nsheet of that tournament for more information.\r\nPlayers Number of\r\nSwiss Rounds Play-off\r\n3 – 4 2 None\r\n5 – 8 3 None\r\n9 – 16 4 Top 4*\r\n17 – 32 5 Top 8\r\n33 – 64 6 Top 8\r\n65 – 128 7 Top 8\r\n129 – 224 8 Top 8\r\n225 – 384 9 Top 8\r\n385 – 736 10 Top 8\r\n... ... ...\r\n*Top 8 if the play-off format is booster draft\r\n38\r\nAppendix C - Time Limits\r\nThe following time limits are recommended for each round of the tournament, (inclusive of the start-of-game\r\nprocedure) based on the format. If the time limits differ from the recommended amounts, the Tournament\r\nOrganizer is required to inform Players prior to the beginning of the tournament or it must be clearly stated in\r\nevent advertising. Round times for the game formats are based on 1 game to win a match and are inclusive of the\r\n5 minutes for the start-of-game procedure.\r\nFormat Time Limit\r\nClassic Constructed 55 minutes\r\nBlitz 35 minutes\r\nSealed Deck 30 minutes\r\nBooster Draft 30 minutes\r\nWelcome Deck 30 minutes\r\nSealed deck registration 30 minutes\r\nSealed deck construction 30 minutes\r\nDraft deck registration 15 minutes\r\nDraft deck construction 15 minutes\r\nThe following time limits are recommended for booster draft operation\r\nCards Draft time\r\n15 50 seconds\r\n14 50 seconds\r\n13 50 seconds\r\n12 50 seconds\r\n11 40 seconds\r\n10 40 seconds\r\n9 30 seconds\r\n8 30 seconds\r\n7 20 seconds\r\n6 20 seconds\r\n5 10 seconds\r\n4 10 seconds\r\n3 5 seconds\r\n2 5 seconds\r\n1 -\r\nThe recommended time limit for the review period is 1 minute.\r\nAll players must have drafted a card, placing it face down into their draft pile, within the time limit. If a player is\r\nconsistently taking more than the time limit to draft a card, they may be subject to penalties.\r\n39\r\nCHAPTER 9. SPECIAL FORMATS\r\nPlayers may not open or pick up a pack passed to them, until the Judge overseeing the draft pod announces\r\nplayers may do so. It’s from the Judge’s announcement, that the timer starts for the next draft pick. The Judge\r\nmay announce to pick up the next pack before the time limit has expired if all players have completed their draft\r\npick from the current pack.\r\n40\r\nAppendix D - Tiebreakers\r\nEvery round, each player plays a match against another player, unless they have been awarded a bye. The result\r\nof each match played is reported to the Scorekeeper and at the end of a round, players are ordered in a list based\r\non their overall performance during the tournament (i.e. player standings). During the tournament, players\r\nimprove their standing by gaining match points and avoiding losses:\r\nResult Letter Points\r\nWin W 1\r\nBye B 1\r\nDraw D 0\r\nLoss L 0\r\nThe following tie-breakers are used in sequence to determine the order of player standings.\r\nStep 1: The player with the higher Match Points\r\nStep 2: The player with the higher Cumulative Match Points\r\nStep 3: The player with the lower Match Loss Percentage\r\nStep 4: The player with the lower average Opponent Match Loss Percentage\r\nStep 5: The player with the higher average Opponent Cumulative Match Points\r\nStep 6: A player selected at random\r\nCumulative Match Points (CMP):\r\nThe player whose total Match Points were higher at the most recent point in the tournament will have the better\r\nCMP tiebreaker. The CMP for a player is calculated as a fractional number between 0 and 1:\r\nCMP =\r\nX\r\nR\r\nr\r\nmr(R2 − 2\r\nr−1\r\n)\r\nR2 − 2\r\nr−1\r\nwhere R is the total number of completed rounds, r is the round number, mr is 1 if the player had a win in round\r\nr and 0 otherwise. If a Player has Match Wins equal to the round number, their CMP will be 1; if the Player has 0\r\nMatch Wins, their CMP will be 0.\r\nMatch Loss % (MLP):\r\nThe player with the fewest average losses of matches (of the matches that they’ve played) will have the better\r\nMLP tiebreaker. The MLP is calculated as a fractional number between 0 and 1:\r\nMLP =\r\nX\r\nRp\r\nr\r\nlr\r\nRp\r\n41\r\nCHAPTER 9. SPECIAL FORMATS\r\nwhere Rp is the total number of completed played rounds, r is the round number, lr is 1 if the player had a loss in\r\nround r and 0 otherwise. If a Player has a bye in a round, that round is not considered to have been played by the\r\nPlayer. If a Player has a draw in a round, it is not considered a loss in that round. With this metric, byes are worse\r\nthan draws (if the Player has any losses at all), and losses are worse than draws (because they increase the MLP).\r\n42\r\nAppendix E - Card-Pool Registration Requirements\r\nThe following card-pool registration requirements are stated for each REL and format. If the requirement differs\r\nfrom the following, the Tournament Organizer it must be clearly stated in event advertising.\r\nRules Enforcement Level Format Deck Registration Required\r\nProfessional Constructed Yes\r\nProfessional Limited Yes\r\nCompetitive Constructed Yes\r\nCompetitive Limited Yes\r\nCasual Constructed No*\r\nCasual Limited No*\r\nCasual Welcome Deck No\r\n*unless specified by the Tournament Organizer\r\nConstructed Format Decklists\r\nFor constructed formats, a Player’s decklist must list every card they intend to play in that format.

General\r\nThe Flesh and Blood - Procedure and Penalty Guide provides a structure of procedures and penalties for judges\r\nto apply to official tournaments for all rules enforcement levels. The purpose of this document is to ensure there\r\nis a consistent application of procedures and penalties for infractions that occur during a tournament so that the\r\nintegrity of the tournament is upheld.\r\n1.1. Philosophy\r\n“Our mission is to bring people together in the flesh and blood through the common language of\r\nplaying great games.”\r\nThe game of Flesh and Blood is designed for in-person play, and with that comes the challenge of handling\r\ninevitable human error where the rules or policies of the game or tournament are broken. These errors\r\n(infractions) can be roughly categorized into gameplay, tournament, or conduct. Gameplay errors are infractions\r\nof the game rules as defined by the Comprehensive Rules. Tournament errors are infractions of the tournament\r\nrules as defined by Tournament Rules and Policy. Conduct errors are infractions of the player’s conduct in\r\nrelation to both the game and tournament rules and cover the general behavior expected of a player. This\r\ndocument provides a guideline for handling these infractions. It categorizes the most common infractions and\r\nprovides insight into how to address them with procedures and penalties.\r\nWhen an infraction occurs during an event, the role of a judge is to act as an impartial arbiter to address the\r\ninfraction by applying procedures and issuing penalties, educating the players, and equalizing any advantage\r\ngained. Judges should not intervene in an ongoing game unless an infraction has occurred. In addition, there is no\r\nneed for a judge to intervene if an infraction with a Caution penalty has occurred or if an infraction with a\r\nWarning penalty is mutually resolved between the players in a timely manner. It should be recognised that no\r\ndocument could ever capture the context of every infraction that could occur and provide the exact procedures\r\nand penalties nuance it deserves. As such, the Judges for an event are empowered to deviate from this guide to\r\nprovide the most appropriate ruling for given infractions.\r\nThere are three principles behind ruling an infraction: education, equity, and mission.\r\n• Education means ensuring that the player(s) understand the infraction and its consequences. A player\r\nshould be made aware of the infraction they have committed; what has occurred, why it is an infraction,\r\nand what the process is to address it. Players are discouraged from committing an infraction if there is a\r\npenalty associated with it and are less likely to commit the same infraction in the future if they are aware of\r\nwhat they have done wrong - even more so when there is an increasing penalty.\r\n• Equity means ensuring that the player(s) lose any advantage from committing the infraction. A procedure\r\nshould be used to remedy the game state and remove any advantage gained if possible, and a penalty may\r\nbe applied to introduce an additional disadvantage to equalize the situation. Players are less likely to\r\ncommit infractions if they will always end up in the same or a more disadvantageous situation.\r\n– Information advantage is when a player gains additional information about the private state of the\r\ngame that they should not have.\r\n– State advantage is when the game state changes to become more favorable to one player.\r\n– Strategic advantage is when a player gains strategic information that may influence their future\r\ngameplay decisions.\r\n– Tournament advantage is when a player artificially gains a more favorable standing, or forces a less\r\nfavorable standing for another player, in the current tournament.\r\n1\r\nCHAPTER 1. GENERAL\r\n• Mission means to balance the education and equity of procedures and penalties with the mission statement\r\nof “playing great games”. While it is important that procedures and penalties are applied to educate players\r\nand equalize advantages, they should be applied in a context that allows the players to play great games.\r\nIn casual events, games are focused on socialization and creating experiences, so the fixes are liberal and\r\npenalties are gentle to allow for better education of players rather than minor advantages gained by any\r\nplayer. In competitive events, games are focused on skill and competition, so the procedures are strict and\r\npenalties are harsh to allow for fairness of the game rather than focusing on educating players.\r\nThis document presents a guide for the three rules enforcement levels of official tournament play: Casual,\r\nCompetitive, and Professional.\r\n• Casual rules enforcement is designed for local in-store play, where there is a low barrier to entry, low\r\nstakes, and the tournament environment is social and informative. Emphasis is placed on the education and\r\nenjoyment of players rather than the strict equity and integrity of each game.\r\n• Competitive rules enforcement is designed for competition, where the barrier to entry may still be low, but\r\nthere are higher stakes and the environment is focused on winning. Infractions are categorized and\r\nenforced more rigidly, and fixes and penalties are based on a balance of education and equity.\r\n• Professional rules enforcement is designed for the highest levels of competitive tournaments, where the\r\nbarrier to entry is high, and the environment is very competitive. Players are expected to play at a level\r\nwhere they are knowledgeable enough about the game that education is less relevant in playing great games\r\nthan the equity/fairness of each game. As such the suggested penalty for many infractions is increased.\r\n1.2. Handling an infraction\r\nInfractions are addressed by first identifying what infraction has occurred, then following the corresponding\r\ninstructions relevant to the situation.\r\nIf a penalty is issued for an infraction, the judge must explain the infraction, the procedure for addressing the\r\nsituation, and the penalty to all players involved. Any penalty of an IP2 or higher should first be confirmed with\r\nthe Head Judge, with the exception of Tardiness and Decklist Error (see Section 4.1 - Tardiness and Section 4.4 -\r\nDecklist Error). If a player commits more than one related infraction, procedures for each infraction are applied\r\nseparately, but only the highest penalty of all infractions is issued (instead of issuing compounding penalties). A\r\ntime extension for the round should be issued to the players involved if the ruling has taken more than one\r\nminute, rounded up to the minute.\r\nJudges are not immune to making mistakes. When a judge makes a mistake, the first step is to acknowledge the\r\nmistake, apologize to the players, and work towards fixing it if possible. If a judge’s mistake leads to a player\r\ncommitting a violation, the Head Judge may take the mistake into consideration as a reason for the deviation.\r\nDeviations\r\nIn some cases, an exceptional situation can not be cleanly categorized into one of the sections listed in this\r\ndocument, or the recommended procedure/penalty for an infraction does not accurately address the situation in\r\nline with the three guiding principles of education, equity, and mission.\r\nIn these cases, the Head Judge has the authority to deviate from the recommendations and apply/issue a modified\r\nprocedure and/or penalty. If they do, the Head Judge is expected to explain the standard policy and the reason for\r\nthe deviation to all players involved. Judges can and should confer with the Head Judge and recommend a\r\ndeviation when they think it is necessary, but the decision to deviate should ultimately be left to the Head Judge\r\nto ensure that deviations are made with some consistency for the duration of the tournament. Reasons for\r\ndeviating from policy include but are not limited to:\r\n2\r\nCHAPTER 1. GENERAL\r\n• A player who has technically committed a gameplay infraction is given a Warning, but a deviation from the\r\nrecommended procedure would produce a more equitable game state.\r\n• A player has committed an infraction and the procedure or penalty does not address the exceptional\r\ncircumstances in a way that is fair.\r\n• A player has committed many related infractions at once, and only an increased penalty would equalize the\r\nadvantage gained.\r\nInfractions in this guide are presented in their most common form; if an infraction occurs that diverges from this\r\nform, it is up to the judges to decide on the fix and/or penalty that should apply and up to the Head Judge to\r\napprove. When deciding on a fix and/or penalty for an infraction, one should start with the most relevant\r\ninfraction and diverge with these three questions in mind:\r\n• Will this help players learn? (education)\r\n• Will this make the situation fair? (equity)\r\n• Will this ensure that players will play great games? (mission)\r\nThe procedures and penalties in this guide both educate judges on the recommended way to rule the most\r\ncommon infractions and protect them from being liable in the application of rulings. If a judge makes a ruling\r\nthat is in line with the procedures and penalties presented in this guide, any complaints become directed at the\r\npolicy itself rather than the judge. In addition, this guide lays out the expectations for players, which helps them\r\nto play better games because they can expect consistency in the procedures and penalties for committing\r\ninfractions. This is not the case for deviations and should be considered when applying a procedure or penalty\r\nthat deviates from this guide.\r\n1.3. Types of Procedures\r\nRewind the game state\r\nRewinding the game state means altering the game state in its entirety to a previous legal game state. When\r\nperformed correctly, this procedure removes any possible state advantage a player may have gained through\r\nillegal action. However, it does not address information advantage (a player cannot be made to forget something)\r\nand in certain situations, it may introduce a strategic advantage.\r\nPartial fix\r\nPartially fixing the game state means artificially altering the game state. When performed correctly, this\r\nprocedure can remove or aid in equalizing a state advantage gained by a player through illegal action. Partial\r\nfixes aim to be a way to restore the integrity of the game without having to significantly interfere with the game,\r\nsuch as when you rewind the game state or introduce a harsher penalty like an IP2 in order to equalize a state\r\nadvantage.\r\nCards to the top or bottom of the deck\r\nPutting cards to the top or the bottom of the deck means changing the location of specific cards to a position in\r\nthe deck as decided by one player. If multiple cards are to be put to the top or the bottom of the deck, the player\r\nchooses the order of the cards and whether it goes to the top or bottom for each card. When performed correctly\r\nalong with other procedures, this can help equalize information and strategic advantages gained by a player\r\nthrough game or tournament errors. Because the position of cards in the deck is a key part of Flesh and Blood’s\r\ngame design, it is impractical for many infractions to ensure that cards can be shuffled into the randomized\r\nportion of a deck, so this procedure takes an alternative approach to create a more equitable game state.\r\n3\r\nCHAPTER 1. GENERAL\r\nShuffle into a random portion of the deck\r\nShuffling into a random portion of the deck means taking the contiguous randomized portion of a deck, adding\r\nand removing any cards, and shuffling it before returning it with the non-randomized portions in the correct\r\nlocations. When performed correctly, this procedure can completely remove the state or information advantage a\r\nplayer may have gained through game or tournament errors. However, due to the fundamental design of Flesh\r\nand Blood, the position of cards in the deck is often non-random which makes it difficult to apply this procedure.\r\nAs such this procedure should only be used as part of a deviation when appropriate for the given game state and\r\ninfraction.\r\n1.4. Types of Penalties\r\nPenalties are an additional tool for judges to track player infractions, educate players by discouraging them from\r\ncommitting future infractions, and equalize advantages gained by committing infractions. The following\r\npenalties here are listed in ascending order of severity. When a penalty would be upgraded or downgraded, the\r\njudge issues a penalty that is more or less severe respectively.\r\nSeverity Penalty\r\n0 Caution\r\n1 Warning\r\n2 Intellect Penalty\r\n3 Game Loss\r\n4 Match Loss\r\n5 Disqualification\r\nCaution\r\nA Caution is an informal warning for minor infractions. Cautions should be used when an infraction is not worth\r\nrecording for the duration of the tournament, such as when an infraction is committed that does not gain the\r\nplayer an advantage, or when both players mutually fix an infraction and no advantage is gained. Typically,\r\njudges should not intervene in games where an infraction would be penalized with a Caution, unless there is an\r\nequity issue (cases where a deviation may be considered), or the Judge needs to determine if the player\r\nintentionally broke the rules to gain an advantage.\r\nWarning\r\nA Warning is a formal warning for a minor infraction that has occurred and is recorded in the system. Warnings\r\nare recorded in the system for the current tournament to keep track of which errors each player has incurred.\r\nMultiple instances of the warning for the same or similar reasons may result in an upgrade to a harsher penalty.\r\nIntellect Penalty\r\nAn Intellect Penalty (IP) is a penalty that reduces the intellect of the player’s hero for a set duration of the game.\r\nBecause the game of Flesh and Blood is fundamentally based on the hero’s intellect, penalizing this aspect of the\r\ngame allows a finer resolution of a penalty than a Game Loss, while also being more severe than a Warning. This\r\nis particularly relevant when the match structure is best of 1.\r\nAn Intellect Penalty is considered a game macro with the following text:\r\nYour hero has -1{i}.\r\nIf you would create an Intellect Penalty with X counters on it, instead add X turn counters onto this.\r\nIf you would draw up to your hero’s intellect as an end-of-turn procedure, instead draw that many\r\ncards, remove a turn counter from this, and remove it from the game if it has no turn counters on it.\r\n4\r\nCHAPTER 1. GENERAL\r\nWhile a player currently has an Intellect Penalty, they draw 1 less card at the end of the turn from the game\r\nsystem. After a player draws up to their hero’s intellect at the end of a turn (including drawing up at the end of\r\nthe first turn), they remove a turn counter from the Intellect Penalty and if it has no turn counters it gets removed\r\nfrom the game (the penalty is now complete). If a player receives another Intellect Penalty while currently\r\nsubject to one, the turn counters of the new Intellect Penalty will be added to the existing Intellect Penalty\r\ninstead. It does not stack and cause the player to draw 2 fewer cards, it only extends the time the current Intellect\r\nPenalty is applied. Players are recommended to put a die on top of their deck to keep track of how many turns of\r\nthe Intellect Penalty remain.\r\nAn Intellect Penalty can be issued for either 2 (IP2) or 3 (IP3) turns. When a penalty is upgraded or downgraded\r\nto an Intellect Penalty, an IP2 is issued.\r\nIf an Intellect Penalty is issued to a player before a game begins, the number of cards in their hand that player\r\nstarts the game with will be affected by the Intellect Penalty. If Intellect Penalties (with equal value) are\r\nsimultaneously issued to all players in a game, the infraction is recorded, but the game resumes as though neither\r\nplayer received an Intellect Penalty.\r\nGame Loss\r\nA Game Loss is a penalty that ends the current game and the player issued the penalty is considered to have lost\r\nthe game. A Game Loss is used when the integrity of the game is irreversibly compromised by an infraction, or\r\nas a harsh punishment to educate the player on their actions.\r\nIf the player is between games, the Game Loss applies to the next game they would play. If the player is issued a\r\nGame Loss in a best of 1 format, they effectively lose the match. If Game Losses are simultaneously issued to all\r\nplayers in a game, the infraction is recorded, but the game is played as though neither player lost.\r\nMatch Loss\r\nA Match Loss is a penalty that ends the current match and the player issued the penalty is considered to have lost\r\nthe match, regardless of the game score. A Match Loss is used when the integrity of the match is irreversibly\r\ncompromised, or as a harsher punishment than Game Loss.\r\nIf the player is between matches, the Match Loss applies to the next match they would play. If Match Losses are\r\nsimultaneously issued to all players in a game, the match is recorded as a double match loss.\r\nDisqualification\r\nA Disqualification is a penalty that results in the player being removed entirely from the tournament. A\r\ndisqualification is the harshest penalty a player can receive at a tournament and is reserved for actions that\r\ncompromise the integrity of a tournament as a whole or for severe conduct errors.\r\nA player who is issued a Disqualification loses their current match (if they are currently playing a match), and is\r\ndropped from the tournament. A disqualified player does not receive any additional prizes they are due but may\r\nkeep any prizes they have received up until that point. When a player is dropped due to Disqualification, they do\r\nnot have a place in the standings meaning that all players below them will advance in the standings by one. If the\r\nDisqualification takes place after a cut is made, no additional players will advance into the cut, even if they move\r\nup the standings by one.\r\nThe Head Judge and the disqualified player are responsible for completing the disqualification form, which\r\nallows them to share their side of the story. The player disqualification form and the head judge disqualification\r\nform are available in the Rules and Policy Center. Players who have been disqualified from a Legend Story\r\nStudios (LSS) event will have their player status reviewed by the Player Conduct Committee.\r\n5\r\n2. Casual - Infractions\r\n2.1. Casual - Philosophy\r\nFor casual players at local events, the term “great games” often means friendly competition in a welcoming,\r\nlighthearted, and social environment. The casual rules enforcement level aims to provide this with emphasis on\r\nfacilitating games through education, but also keeping games relatively fair. Both players and judges are\r\nencouraged to help one another at appropriate times, and players are encouraged to solve any infractions through\r\nmutual agreement before calling for a Judge. If no Judge is not available, the role falls to the Tournament\r\nOrganizer.\r\nThere are no Warnings or Intellect Penalties at the Casual REL. Minor infractions are handled by fixing the game\r\nstate and educating/cautioning the player on the infraction to help prevent repeat interactions. Major infractions\r\nare handled with Game/Match Losses, or Disqualification as a last resort, to preserve the safety and the integrity\r\nof the tournament. If the event requires deck lists, provides high stakes, or the players are looking for a more\r\ncompetitive environment, upgrading the REL to Competitive is recommended.\r\nJudges should continue to uphold the Judge Code of Conduct, but rule to meet the expectations of the event and\r\nthe players in line with the three guiding principles. What follows are some common errors that can occur and\r\nthe procedures and penalties recommended for a Casual REL tournament. The level of intervention and how a\r\njudge deviates from these recommendations depends on the environment that the Tournament Organizer wants to\r\nachieve.\r\n2.2. Casual - Gameplay Errors\r\nA player makes a game rules error\r\nMost gameplay errors can be addressed by partially fixing what was illegal and letting play continue. If the error\r\ninvolved the player forgetting a simple action (drawing, discarding, paying a cost, putting a counter on an card),\r\nhave them take that action now. Otherwise, if the error was caught immediately, rewind the game state by\r\nundoing actions taken by the players until you’re at the point in the game before the error was made. If too many\r\nactions have been taken (by both players) that rewinding would be too disruptive, partially fix anything that is\r\ncurrently illegal within the game and let play proceed.\r\nA player forgets a triggered effect\r\nA triggered effect is an effect that starts with or contains “when”, “whenever”, “at the”, and “the X time”. A\r\ntriggered effect is considered missed if the controlling player did not acknowledge the effect before it has had an\r\neffect on the game (see Section 3.3 - Missed Trigger for a more in-depth explanation of when a trigger is missed).\r\nIf the effect was optional (contains the word “may”), assume that the player chose not to resolve it. If neither\r\nplayer has made critical decisions based on the trigger not happening and the effect would not be disruptive at\r\nthis point in the game, put the trigger on the stack. Otherwise, the trigger is considered completely missed, and\r\nlet play proceed without it.\r\nA player sees a card they shouldn’t have seen\r\nIf the card was in the player’s deck, shuffle it into a random portion of the player’s deck. It is acceptable to\r\nshuffle it into only part of the deck, but you must avoid shuffling cards with known locations within the deck. If\r\nthe majority of the deck is ordered (especially from pitching over several turns), or if the card wasn’t in the\r\nplayer’s deck, just reveal the card to the opponent and leave the card in the zone it was originally.\r\n6\r\nCHAPTER 2. CASUAL - INFRACTIONS\r\nA player draws more cards than they were supposed to\r\nIf the extra cards were already known to all players, return those cards to the top of the deck. Otherwise,\r\nrandomly select a card for each extra card drawn this way by the player and put them on the top of the deck.\r\n2.3. Casual - Tournament Errors\r\nA player turns up late for a round\r\nIf a player is seated less than 10 minutes late, give the players that much extra time to complete their match. If a\r\nplayer is seated 10 or more minutes late for a round, issue them a match loss. If the player can’t be found for the\r\nentire round, drop them from the tournament so the situation doesn’t repeat in the next round.\r\nA player talks with another person during a match or draft\r\nIn a more social environment communication with spectators or other players, during a match or drafting, can\r\noften be excused. Strategic communication during these times should be considered outside assistance and\r\ntreated as unsportsman-like conduct as described below.\r\nA player has an illegal deck\r\nFirst, the Judge removes any cards that shouldn’t be in the deck and any insert cards that should, then if the deck\r\nis below the minimum required size, insert Cracked Baubles until it reaches that size. If the error is discovered\r\nduring the start of a game, any inserted cards should be shuffled into a random portion of the deck. It is\r\nacceptable to shuffle it into only part of the deck, but you must avoid shuffling cards with known locations within\r\nthe deck. If the majority of the deck is ordered do not insert any cards until after the game has been completed.\r\n2.4. Casual - Conduct Errors\r\nA player is being unsportsman-like\r\nIf a player is showing unsporting behavior, they may be affecting both the integrity or the enjoyment of the\r\ntournament as a whole. Unsporting behavior means the player’s conduct violates the game or tournament rules of\r\nthe event; this includes:\r\n• Taking an unreasonable amount of time to make decisions within the match.\r\n• Requesting or providing strategic assistance during a match or draft.\r\n• Bribing or otherwise convincing an opponent to determine the match result by anything other than playing\r\nthe game or Wagering on the results of a match.\r\n• Arguing with the Judge or Tournament Organizer about a decision or the tournament in general.\r\nMany players will commit these errors unintentionally, so the priority is to educate players and give them an\r\nopportunity to correct their actions and behavior. If it continues, reinforcing the education can be done using a\r\nGame Loss. A player who intentionally breaks these rules is considered serious misconduct.\r\nA player commits serious misconduct\r\nIf a player irreversibly compromises the integrity of the tournament or behaves in a way that affects other people\r\nnegatively, this is a serious error that should be stopped and addressed immediately; this includes:\r\n• Behaviour (physical or verbal) that makes another person feel abused, threatened, harassed, scared,\r\nbelittled, or unsafe; especially aggressive or violent behavior.\r\n• Intentionally breaking the game or tournament rules and/or lying about these rules to gain an advantage.\r\n• Stealing from the tournament materials or another person at the venue.\r\n7\r\nCHAPTER 2. CASUAL - INFRACTIONS\r\n• Ignoring the direct instruction of a Judge or Tournament Organizer, related to the tournament.\r\nEfforts should be made to educate players on why these actions or behaviors are unacceptable and to deescalate\r\nsituations before serious misconduct occurs. Players who commit serious misconduct should be disqualified and\r\nmay be removed from the venue at the Tournament Organizer’s discretion.\r\n8\r\n3. Competitive and Professional - Gameplay Infractions\r\nGameplay infractions are caused by play that violates the rules of the game as defined by the Flesh and Blood\r\nComprehensive Rules. Gameplay infractions are assumed to be committed unintentionally, but if a judge suspects\r\nthat the infraction was intentional then it could be considered Cheating (see Section 5.2 - Cheating).\r\nIf a player commits 3 or more gameplay infractions of the same type (except for Failure to Maintain Game State)\r\non a given tournament day, the penalty that would be given for that infraction should be upgraded by 1 severity\r\nlevel. This penalty count does not accumulate over multiple days and is reset at the end of each day for a multiday tournament.\r\n3.1. Game Rules Violation Warning\r\nThe player, in some capacity, fails to apply the rules correctly to elements of the game they are responsible for in\r\na way that is not specified by another Gameplay Infraction.\r\nPlayers are responsible for ensuring that their actions, or inaction, follow the rules of the game. Players have a\r\nshared responsibility for the rules of the game when they introduce effects that interact with their opponent, or\r\nwhen they instruct their opponent to perform certain actions.\r\nIf an opponent allows the player to commit a Game Rules Violation (that the opponent is not responsible for),\r\nthe opponent has committed Failure to Maintain Game State (see Section 3.2 - Failure to Maintain Game State),\r\nexcept in cases where there is a shared responsibility so both players have committed a Game Rules Violation.\r\nPhilosophy\r\nIn the most typical case, when the player commits a Game Rule Violation, they potentially gain a state advantage\r\nand/or information advantage. While it is the responsibility of each player to ensure that the rules of the game are\r\ncorrectly applied to their actions/inaction, all players are responsible for maintaining the shared game state.\r\nIf an infraction is caught immediately, rewinding can remove any state advantage gained by the player and\r\nprevents additional information or strategic advantage from being gained by the opponent responding to an\r\nincorrect game state. As soon as additional actions have been made by either player, fixing the issue becomes\r\nmore nuanced. The Judge must assess the game state and decide if rewinding the game to the point of the mistake\r\nor partially fixing the game state is better suited to achieve a more equitable situation.\r\nIf the procedures can not be applied without significantly disrupting the game, mostly due to too many plays\r\nmade after the infraction has been made, issuing an IP2 can help balance the game state and reduce the advantage\r\ngained from the infraction.\r\nExamples:\r\n• A player plays a card or activates an ability without paying the full cost to do so.\r\n• A player defends with a card from their arsenal.\r\n• A player plays an action card on their opponent’s turn without playing it as an instant.\r\n• A player forgets to draw up to their hero’s intellect at the end of their turn.\r\n• A player plays a card when an opponent’s card prevents them from doing so (shared responsibility).\r\n9\r\nCHAPTER 3. COMPETITIVE AND PROFESSIONAL - GAMEPLAY INFRACTIONS\r\nProcedure and Penalty\r\nIf the Game Rule Violation is caught immediately, issue the player a Warning for Game Rule Violation and\r\nrewind the game state to the time it was last legal.\r\nIf additional actions to the Game Rule Violation have been made by either player, Issue the player a Warning for\r\nGame Rule Violation. Evaluate the game state and apply either rewind the game state to the point of the error or\r\napply a partial fix to remove the advantage gained by the player. If the game can not be rewound and the game\r\nstate can not be partially fixed to remove a significant advantage gained by the player, upgrade to an IP2.\r\nIn addition to the penalty for the player, if the opponent had a reasonable opportunity to acknowledge the Game\r\nRule Violation but did not, issue the opponent a Warning for Failure to Maintain Game State. If there is shared\r\nresponsibility for the error, instead issue the opponent a Warning for Game Rule Violation.\r\n3.2. Failure to Maintain Game State Warning\r\nThe player(s), through their own inaction, has not acknowledged an opponent’s gameplay infraction other than\r\nMissed Trigger.\r\nPhilosophy\r\nIn situations where an opponent commits a gameplay infraction, a player may consequently gain a state\r\nadvantage by allowing the game to proceed. If a gameplay infraction is caught earlier, the potential state\r\nadvantage gained by either player is minimized and can possibly be rewound without issue. However, if the game\r\ncontinues then the fault lies with both players. For a player who intentionally fails to acknowledge an opponent’s\r\ngameplay infraction in order to gain a state (other than Missed Trigger), information, and/or strategic advantage,\r\nsee Section 5.2 - Cheating.\r\nExamples:\r\n• The opponent defends with a card without the defense property, and the player does not notice until after\r\nthe turn is over.\r\n• The opponent plays and resolves a card and starts searching through their deck, and then the player\r\nnotices that they don’t have enough resources to play the card.\r\nProcedure and Penalty\r\nFollow the recommended procedure and penalties for the opponent’s gameplay infraction, then issue the player a\r\nWarning for Failure to Maintain Game State.\r\n3.3. Missed Trigger Caution / Warning\r\nThe player, by their own inaction, has not acknowledged the resolution of a triggered effect they control before\r\nits effects become relevant.\r\nAcknowledging a triggered effect requires either a visible change to the game state from its effect or\r\ncommunication between the players that confirms that that effect has been triggered. Visible changes include\r\nchanges to the existence and location of physical objects such as cards, tokens, macros, and counters; and\r\nchanges to life totals for heroes. Any player can acknowledge a triggered effect, not just its controller. The point\r\nwhen a triggered layer becomes relevant is different for different triggers, and if the following criteria are met for\r\nthe trigger is it not considered missed:\r\n10\r\nCHAPTER 3. COMPETITIVE AND PROFESSIONAL - GAMEPLAY INFRACTIONS\r\n• A triggered effect that requires its controller to make decisions (such as choose targets or modes) must be\r\nacknowledged before the controller next passes priority.\r\n• A triggered effect that affects the rules of the game must be acknowledged before an action is taken, or\r\nacknowledged by stopping an action taken by a player, that otherwise would be made illegal by the\r\ntriggered effect.\r\n• A triggered effect that affects the game state in a visible way upon resolution, or requires any player to\r\nmake decisions upon resolution, must be acknowledged before any player takes an in-game action that\r\ncould only be taken after the triggered effect has resolved.\r\n• A triggered effect that affects the game state in a non-visible way must be acknowledged before it first\r\nvisibly effects the game state.\r\nIf the resolution of a triggered effect would have no impact on the game, failing to acknowledge it is not\r\nconsidered an infraction. If the only part of a triggered effect that would have an impact on the game is optional\r\nand it is not acknowledged, it is assumed that the controlling player decided to not generate that effect and it is\r\nnot considered an infraction. If part of a triggered effect can be considered resolved and had a visible impact on\r\nthe game, the trigger is considered acknowledged and any other part of the trigger being missed is considered a\r\nGame Rules Violation (see Section 3.1 - Game Rules Violation).\r\nPlayers are responsible for the resolution of any triggered effects they control. Players are not required to\r\nacknowledge triggered effects they don’t control even if they are involved in the resolution of the effect, though\r\nthey may still do so. The controlling player is responsible for ensuring that any decisions or actions taken by the\r\nopponent for the resolution of the effect are legal and appropriate; they may not assume their opponent choose\r\nnot to take any optional action.\r\nWhile it may benefit a player not to acknowledge the triggered effects of their opponents, they may not\r\nintentionally cause them to be missed. As such the trigger is only considered missed if the controlling player\r\nacknowledges or allows the progression of the game state passed the point of trigger relevancy without first\r\nacknowledging the triggered effect. Intentionally progressing the game state to cause another player to miss a\r\ntriggered effect is considered Rules Sharking (see Section 5.10 - Rules Sharking).\r\nPhilosophy\r\nSimilar to Game Rules Violations, missing the resolution of a trigger compromises the integrity of the game state\r\nand may create a state advantage for the player. Unlike playing a card or activating an ability, triggered-effects\r\n(and the resolution of triggered-layers) are only relevant as the consequence of other actions and events within\r\nthe game, as opposed to direct actions taken by the player. Because they are so common and often invisible to\r\nthe game state, players should not be harshly penalized when one is missed. However, intentionally ignoring a\r\ntriggered effect your control is considered Cheating.\r\nIn some cases, players may be responsible for detrimental triggered effects imposed by the opponent. Because\r\nthe triggered effect was introduced by the opponent, it’s more likely that the player will miss it triggering, which\r\ncan lead to unfair compounding penalties for players who aren’t familiar with effects from their opponent’s cardpool. These infractions are punished less harshly for this reason.\r\nExamples:\r\n• A player attacks with Crane Dance then Heron’s Flight and forgets to declare the mode of the triggered\r\neffect. They only realize after they’ve acknowledged the opponent’s defending cards.\r\n• A player hits their opponent with Red in the Ledger, forgets to declare the triggered effect, and does not\r\nstop the opponent from playing and resolving a second action during their turn.\r\n• A player controls a Soul Shackle, forgets to banish a card at the start of their turn, and plays an action\r\ncard.\r\n11\r\nCHAPTER 3. COMPETITIVE AND PROFESSIONAL - GAMEPLAY INFRACTIONS\r\n• A player hits their opponent with Brandish, then attacks them again with a weapon. When applying the\r\nlife total from the weapon attack, the player forgets to add +1p into the calculation.\r\nProcedure and Penalty\r\nIf the trigger is not considered missed, but the game state has progressed to a point where the triggered effect\r\nwould be relevant, rewind the game state to the latest point the trigger should have been acknowledged. This\r\nprevents the opponent from prematurely advancing the game state when the player has not yet acknowledged the\r\ntriggered effect and allows the game state integrity to be preserved.\r\nIf it has been less than a turn cycle from when the triggered effect was missed, the opponent may choose to add\r\nit to the stack. If they do, the triggered effect is added at the appropriate place on the stack, or at the bottom of\r\nthe stack. Less than a turn cycle means if the triggered effect should have been triggered in the player’s action\r\nphase, once it becomes the opponent’s action phase, a complete turn cycle has passed and it is too late to put it on\r\nthe stack. Triggered effects added to the stack this way can not target or interact with objects that would not have\r\nbeen legal at the time the effect should have triggered.\r\n3.3.1. Missed Trigger - Beneficial Caution\r\nThe player misses a triggered effect that is only beneficial to them. Beneficial effects include (but are not limited\r\nto) gaining life, gaining resources, drawing cards, creating cards/tokens, removing detrimental counters, adding\r\nbeneficial counters, decreases in costs, and increases in power/defense/intellect. If part of the triggered effect is\r\ndetrimental, the entire missing trigger is considered detrimental (see Section 3.3.2 - Missed Trigger -\r\nDetrimental).\r\nExamples:\r\n• A player hits with Snatch and forgets to draw a card.\r\n• A player attacks with Flock of the Feather Walkers and forgets to create a Quicken token.\r\nProcedure and Penalty\r\nIssue the player a Caution and follow the recommended procedure for missed triggers.\r\n3.3.2. Missed Trigger - Detrimental Warning\r\nDetrimental effects are triggers that cause an effect that is detrimental or partially detrimental to the player.\r\nDetrimental effects include (but are not limited to) loss of life, discarding cards, destroying cards/tokens, adding\r\ndetrimental counters, removing beneficial counters, increases in costs, and decreases in power/defense/intellect.\r\nIf part of the triggered effect is detrimental, the entire missing trigger is considered detrimental.\r\nExamples:\r\n• A player controls a Quicken token, plays an attack action card, and does not destroy the Quicken token.\r\n• A player defends with an equipment with Battleworn and forgets to put a -1d counter on it when the\r\ncombat chain closes.\r\n• A player defends with an equipment with Blade Break and forgets to destroy it when the combat chain\r\ncloses.\r\n12\r\nCHAPTER 3. COMPETITIVE AND PROFESSIONAL - GAMEPLAY INFRACTIONS\r\nProcedure and Penalty\r\nIssue the player a Warning and follow the recommended procedure for missed triggers.\r\nIf the triggered effect was ultimately created by an opponent’s card, downgrade to a Caution. Because the\r\ntriggered effect was introduced by the opponent, it’s more likely that the player will miss its triggering which can\r\nlead to unfair compounding penalties for players who aren’t familiar with effects from their opponent’s\r\ncard-pool.\r\n3.4. Looking at Extra Cards Warning\r\nThe player, by their own action, has unintentionally seen cards that were not allowed to see but the cards have not\r\nchanged zone.\r\nPhilosophy\r\nWhen the player sees cards that were initially hidden from them, they gain information about the private state of\r\nthe game and therefore gain an information advantage. When the card is owned by the player, they only gain an\r\nadvantage of knowing the relative position of the card, but if the card is owned by the opponent, then they also\r\ngain information about the opponent’s card-pool and the current locations of those cards (especially if they’re in\r\nthe deck).\r\nIn rare cases, if the cards were from the player’s randomized deck, shuffling them back into the deck removes the\r\ninformation advantage entirely, as they already knew what cards were in their deck. The issue with this approach\r\nis that non-randomized decks are rare, especially with the pitching mechanic of Flesh and Blood. The alternative\r\nmethod of putting the extra card to the top or bottom (directed by the opponent) does not remove the information\r\nadvantage, but it does balance the advantage by giving an equivalent advantage to the opponent; knowing the card\r\nand choosing its position in the zone.\r\nIf the number of extra cards seen is large, rather than allow the opponent to stack an entire portion of the player’s\r\ndeck, shuffling the deck removes the significant information advantage gained by the player and avoids issues\r\nwith the typical procedure where the opponent would gain an unfair advantage.\r\nExamples:\r\n• A player sees extra cards when drawing.\r\n• A player sees extra cards when revealing/looking at cards from their, or their opponent’s, deck.\r\n• A player sees cards from their opponent’s deck while shuffling it.\r\n• A player accidentally knocks some cards off the top of their deck face-up.\r\nProcedure and Penalty\r\nIf the extra card is part of the player’s fully randomized deck, issue the player a Caution and shuffle the extra card\r\ninto the deck.\r\nIf the extra card is part of the player’s non-randomized deck, issue the player a Warning. If the extra card was\r\npreviously known to the player (through effects like opt or reveal), leave the card in the correct position,\r\notherwise, reveal the card to the opponent who chooses for that card to go to the top or bottom of the deck.\r\nIf the extra card is seen as part of the player drawing cards as an end-of-turn procedure, but the opponent has not\r\nacknowledged the change of phase (the opponent wants to play/activate cards/abilities), issue the player a\r\nWarning but leave the cards as they were on the top of the deck. This does not apply if the cards are added to\r\nother cards in the player’s hand (see Section 3.5 - Hidden Card Error).\r\n13\r\nCHAPTER 3. COMPETITIVE AND PROFESSIONAL - GAMEPLAY INFRACTIONS\r\nIf the extra cards include 5 or more cards in the player’s non-randomized deck, shuffle the deck and issue\r\nrecommended penalties for the infraction of Shuffling Error (see Section 3.6 - Shuffling Error).\r\nIf the extra card was part of the player’s non-deck zones or is owned by the opponent, issue the player a Warning,\r\nreveal the card to the opponent and leave the extra card where it was.\r\n3.5. Hidden Card Error Warning\r\nA player, by their own action, has illegally combined hidden cards from two or more zones into a single\r\ncollection of cards; therefore, it is not possible to distinguish which cards in the collection were previously in\r\neach zone.\r\nPhilosophy\r\nWhen the player combines sets of cards that are hidden from the opponent, the integrity of the game state\r\nbecomes compromised and the player gains a possible state advantage - specifically, they are the only one who\r\nknows what the correct state is and that state can not be verified by the opponent. If the player were to fix this\r\nthemselves, they could gain a state advantage by separating the hidden cards incorrectly to create a favorable\r\nstate. If the hidden cards were not known to the player, they have also gained an information advantage by being\r\naware of the position of a card.\r\nAllowing the opponent to choose how they split the collection of cards does not strictly remove the information\r\nadvantage, but provides equity by giving an equivalent information advantage to the opponent; knowing the card,\r\nits zone, and its position in that zone.\r\nExamples:\r\n• A player draws to their intellect of 4 at the end-of-turn but accidentally draws up to 5 cards.\r\n• A player hits with Snatch and draws 2 cards as the card sleeves were stuck together. The cards touch the\r\nplayer’s hand.\r\n• A player plays Whispers of the Oracle, and the cards they ”opt” are mixed in with their hand.\r\nProcedure and Penalty\r\nIssue the player a Warning, then reveal the combined collection of hidden cards to the opponent. The opponent\r\ndecides which cards should be returned to each zone, ensuring that the number of cards in each zone is the same\r\nas before the infraction was committed. The cards are then returned to the zones as designated by the opponent.\r\nIf one of the zones is the deck, the opponent chooses for the card(s) to go to the top and/or bottom of the deck in\r\nany order.\r\n3.6. Shuffling Error IP2\r\nThe player, by their own action, illegally randomizes an ordered set of cards, such as a deck.\r\nPhilosophy\r\nWhen the player shuffles a non-randomized set of cards, the integrity of the game state has been irreversibly\r\ncompromised and either player may gain a state advantage from a redistribution of cards throughout the\r\nrandomized set.\r\nBecause there is no procedure to repair the game state or remove the potential advantage gained, and shuffling the\r\ndeck is a deliberate action, issuing an Intellect Penalty is a fair way to educate the player and help equalize the\r\nadvantage they may have gained over the opponent.\r\n14\r\nCHAPTER 3. COMPETITIVE AND PROFESSIONAL - GAMEPLAY INFRACTIONS\r\nExamples:\r\n• A player shuffles their pitched cards into their deck.\r\n• A player absent-mindedly shuffles their deck mid-game.\r\n• A player starts searching through their deck when they were ineligible to do so and must shuffle to prevent\r\ngaining a considerable information advantage.\r\nProcedure and Penalty\r\nIn all cases, issue the player an IP2 and ensure the deck is sufficiently randomized.\r\nAt professional REL upgrade to an IP3. If the player has gained a significant advantage by shuffling, upgrade to a\r\nGame Loss is recommended.\r\n15\r\n4. Competitive and Professional - Tournament Infractions\r\nTournament infractions are caused by play or behavior that violates the rules of the tournament as defined by the\r\nFlesh and Blood Tournament Rules and Policy. Tournament infractions are assumed to be committed\r\nunintentionally, but if a judge suspects that the infraction was intentional then it could be considered Cheating\r\n(see Section 5.2 - Cheating).\r\nIf a player violates the rules of the tournament and it is not listed in this section as an infraction, the judge should\r\neducate and correct the player on the rules of the tournament, but not issue a penalty. Failure to ignore the\r\ninfractions of the judge is considered Unsporting Conduct (Section 5.1 - Unsporting Conduct).\r\nIf a player commits 2 or more tournament infractions of the same type (except for Tardiness) on a given\r\ntournament day, the penalty that would be given for that infraction should be upgraded by 1 severity level. This\r\npenalty count does not accumulate over multiple days and is reset at the end of each day for a multi-day\r\ntournament.\r\n4.1. Tardiness IP3 / Match Loss\r\nThe player, by their own inaction, is not at their assigned table when the round timer begins.\r\nIf the round timer begins before the previous round would have ended (such as when all the matches have been\r\ncompleted early), tardiness is timed from the scheduled end of the previous round. Judges can issue round start\r\nextensions for players that need additional time between rounds.\r\nThe thresholds for tardiness are 0 (professional) and 3 (competitive) minutes for Minor (see Section 4.1.1 -\r\nTardiness - Minor), and 10 (both) minutes for Major (see Section 4.1.2 - Tardiness - Major). This can be changed\r\nat the Tournament Organizers discretion provided it is announced at the start of the tournament. The player\r\npresent at the table should alert a Judge if their opponent is late or arrives late in order to apply the appropriate\r\npenalty.\r\nPhilosophy\r\nThe integrity of a tournament with timed rounds relies on players completing their match in a timely manner. If\r\nthe winner of a match can not be determined by the end of a round, the match is a draw. Being late to the table\r\ndelays the start of the game making it more likely the game will end in a draw.\r\nIn some cases, a player may be late to their match (especially from forces outside their control) but still wants to\r\ncontinue playing in the tournament despite the match losses. As long as the player indicates they wish to continue\r\ncompeting in the tournament and it does not interrupt the logistics, they should not be dropped.\r\n4.1.1. Tardiness - Minor IP3\r\nThe player arrives 3-10 minutes after the round timer begins at a competitive REL\r\nThe player arrives 0-10 minutes after the round timer begins at a professional REL.\r\nExamples:\r\n• A player arrives at their seat 5 minutes after the round starts.\r\n16\r\nCHAPTER 4. COMPETITIVE AND PROFESSIONAL - TOURNAMENT INFRACTIONS\r\n• A player sits down at the wrong table and does not realize until after they start playing with the incorrect\r\nopponent.\r\nProcedure and Penalty\r\nIssue the player an IP3 and extend the table’s round time by the total time delayed.\r\n4.1.2. Tardiness - Major Match Loss\r\nThe player arrives 10+ minutes after the round timer begins.\r\nExamples:\r\n• A player plays a whole match with the incorrect opponent.\r\n• A player loses cards in their card-pool and cannot find replacement cards within 10 minutes.\r\nProcedure and Penalty\r\nIssue the player a Match Loss. If neither player is present after 10 minutes, issue a double Match Loss. The\r\nplayer(s) should be dropped before the pairing of the next round unless they contact or report to the scorekeeper\r\nbefore then.\r\n4.2. Outside Assistance Game Loss\r\nThe player, by their own actions, gains strategic assistance from a person or resource that is not part of the game;\r\nor gives strategic assistance to another player in a game they are not a part of.\r\nPhilosophy\r\nA competitive game of Flesh and Blood relies on the understanding that the game is played between the players\r\npitting their strategic minds against one another. Introducing outside assistance corrupts the integrity of the game\r\nfor all players involved. There is no game state that can be reversed, and any strategic advantage can not be ungained.\r\nIf the player is in a game and has sought and received outside assistance that gives them a strategic advantage that\r\ncorrupts the integrity of the game, a game loss ensures that this advantage removes and reverses that advantage\r\nentirely, awarding the win to the opponent. If the player is a spectator, they have taken it upon themselves to\r\ncorrupt the integrity of another player’s game, and as such this serves as a strong reminder to uphold the integrity\r\nof competitive events both as a player and a spectator.\r\nExamples:\r\n• A player references sideboard notes in the middle of a game (after the start-of-game procedure has\r\nconcluded).\r\n• A player communicates with a spectator using hand gestures, facial expressions, electronic devices, or\r\nother means of communication.\r\n• A spectator walks past a table with a game in progress and reacts to cards in a player’s hand in a way\r\nthat conveys private information to their opponent.\r\nProcedure and Penalty\r\nIssue the player a Game Loss.\r\n17\r\nCHAPTER 4. COMPETITIVE AND PROFESSIONAL - TOURNAMENT INFRACTIONS\r\nIf the player is a spectator for the game, issue them a Game Loss for their next game and remove them from the\r\nplay area.\r\nIn cases when the strategic assistance is harmless and out of ignorance, consider downgrading to a Warning.\r\n4.3. Slow Play Caution\r\nThe player, by their own action, takes a longer than an acceptable period of time to make a decision that\r\nprogresses the game state without the intention to gain an advantage.\r\nPhilosophy\r\nPlayers are expected to play at a pace that is sufficient to complete their match within the given round time limit.\r\nSlow play makes it more likely the game will end in a draw, giving the opponent a possible tournament\r\ndisadvantage. A player that intentionally plays slowly is considered Stalling (see Section 5.8 - Stalling).\r\nSlow play is subjective because it depends on the context of the game, making it very difficult to moderate. As a\r\ngeneral rule of thumb, if a Judge can understand the game state and come up with a line of plays from the\r\nplayer’s position in the game in the time it takes the player to make a single decision, the player is most likely\r\nplaying too slowly. However, there are many exceptions, especially with decks that have many cards that can be\r\nplayed, or abilities that can be activated, at an instant speed which requires very specific sequencing.\r\nOpponents are expected to call a Judge early in the game if they think a player is taking too long to make\r\ndecisions, to ensure the behavior is corrected before it significantly delays the game. Slow play always occurs\r\nwithout the player’s noticing (as opposed to Stalling), so an educational reminder is enough to ensure that the\r\nmajority of players increase their rate of play to complete the game before the time limit. The penalizing of a\r\nSlow Play infraction should only ever be done when a Judge confirms it by observing the progression of the\r\ngame, not by spectators or player testimony. Judges should not award extra time to the table where there are only\r\nreports or accusations of slow play.\r\nExamples:\r\n• A player checks either player’s graveyard multiple times before taking an action.\r\n• A player takes an excessive time to shuffle after searching through their deck.\r\n• A player has one card in their hand and takes an unreasonable amount of time to decide what to do.\r\nProcedure and Penalty\r\nIf a player is unintentionally playing slowly, issue them a Caution and educate them to increase the speed of their\r\nplay. Observe the game at least until the player has made one or two decisions.\r\nFor repeat infractions, issue a Warning and observe the rate of play. If slow play continues to be observed,\r\nupgrade to a Game Loss.\r\n4.4. Decklist Error IP2\r\nThe player, by their own action, has submitted a card-pool registration sheet (decklist) that does not contain the\r\ncards they intend to play with or is illegal.\r\n18\r\nCHAPTER 4. COMPETITIVE AND PROFESSIONAL - TOURNAMENT INFRACTIONS\r\nPhilosophy\r\nDecklists are an essential part of a competitive tournament. A decklist ensures that the cards that a player is using\r\n(their card-pool) can not be changed over the course of the tournament, removing potential strategic advantages\r\nthat would otherwise be possible.\r\nDecklist entries with ambiguous or unclear card names and/or pitch values may allow the player to change the\r\ncontents of their card-pool up until they are confronted about their decklist. Card monikers (short names for cards\r\nwith personal names) are permissible if it is obvious and unambiguous what card it refers to, based on the context\r\nsuch as the tournament format or other cards in the card-pool. Cards, tokens, and macros created by other cards\r\nin their decklist do not need to be listed themselves, but must still be supplied by the player for any game they\r\nplay.\r\nDecklists with illegal cards, such as banned/suspended cards, compromise the integrity of the tournament, more\r\nso if it is only caught in later rounds. There are cases where off-the-shelf products contain illegal cards and/or\r\nheroes, or players are not aware of recent changes of legality to cards in “meta decks”. Unless the player shows\r\nthe intent of Cheating, it should be assumed that it was unintentional and they should be given an opportunity to\r\ncorrect their decklist.\r\nIf the decklist is legal and reflects what the player intended to play with, but there is an issue with the card-pool\r\nitself it is considered a Card-Pool Contents Error (Section 4.5 - Card-Pool Contents Error).\r\nExamples:\r\n• A player has forgotten to list an equipment on their decklist.\r\n• A player has not included 0 pitch cards on their decklist because they didn’t know what section to put\r\nthem under.\r\n• A player has listed the name of a card, but not its pitch value, so it is ambiguous exactly what card it is.\r\n• A player has listed the moniker (short name) of a hero, but there are 2 or more heroes with that moniker.\r\n• A player has one (1H) card listed but is playing with two of those cards.\r\n• A player lists Snapdragon Scalers as one of their equipment, but they have Ironrot Legs in their card-pool\r\ninstead.\r\n• A player has 3 Potion of Strength on their decklist, but in their card-pool, they have 3 Timesnap Potion\r\nand 0 Potion of Strength.\r\n• A player has listed a recently banned card as their hero and intends to play them.\r\nProcedure and Penalty\r\nIn all cases where the decklist does not contain the cards they intend to play with, update the player’s decklist to\r\nmatch the intent and issue the player an IP2.\r\nIf the decklist contains illegal cards that they intend to play with, issue the player a Match Loss and remove the\r\nillegal cards from the decklist or replace them with Cracked Baubles to ensure the player has enough legally\r\nplayable cards in their deck. If the hero is illegal, but the infraction is caught in the first round, the player may not\r\nplay any games until they submit a new legal decklist. At professional REL, or if the player has gained an\r\nsignificant advantage over the course of the tournament with the illegal cards, upgrade to a Disqualification.\r\nIf the decklist error is minor and is caught before the first round has begun, or if the player reports the error\r\nthemselves between rounds, downgrade to a Warning.\r\nIf there is a significant difference between the decklist and the player’s deck, or the player has gained a significant\r\nstrategic advantage from ambiguous or unclear entries on the decklist, upgrade to a Match Loss. At professional\r\nREL, upgrade to a Disqualification.\r\n19\r\nCHAPTER 4. COMPETITIVE AND PROFESSIONAL - TOURNAMENT INFRACTIONS\r\n4.5. Card-Pool Contents Error IP2\r\nThe player, by their own action, has presented cards that do not match their decklist and the decklist represents\r\nwhat the player intended to play.\r\nThis infraction applies both when a player presents cards during a game and when they present their card-pool\r\nto a judge to be checked. If there are cards stored with the player’s card-pool that could conceivably be in the\r\nPlayer’s registered card-pool due to proximity, they are considered part of the Player’s registered card-pool unless\r\nthey are:\r\n• Cards not the decklist that are promotional cards given out at event.\r\n• Cards on the decklist that have been proxied for the duration of the tournament.\r\n• Double-faced cards represented by official substitute cards in the deck.\r\n• Double-faced cards that are being used represent the back-face of cards in the deck.\r\nThese cards must not be sleeved in a way that they could be confused with actual cards in the registered cardpool. Tokens are not considered part of a player’s card-pool and may be stored with the card-pool even if there\r\nare no registered cards that could ultimately create them. Created cards may be sleeved like registered cards, and\r\nmay be stored with the Player’s registered card-pool without being considered a part of it.\r\nPhilosophy\r\nPlayers are expected to store their hero and registered card-pool contents separately from any other contents that\r\ncould possibly be considered to be part of the card-pool. This may involve having a separate deck-box or\r\ncontainer that contains only the cards for the card-pool for the tournament.\r\nWhen a player stores extra cards with their registered card-pool, or otherwise has access to extra cards during the\r\nthe start-of-game procedure, and those extra cards are not part of their decklist, it creates a potential for abuse\r\nwhere a player can gain a state advantage by playing with those extra cards. Players are expected to call attention\r\nto Card-Pool Content Errors immediately, and not gain any potential advantage from having the extra cards\r\navailable to use in their card-pool for any given game.\r\nExamples:\r\n• A player has stored 4 of the same card (and pitch) in a Classic Constructed tournament.\r\n• A player has stored an equipment card, that is not on the decklist, with their other equipment cards.\r\n• A player has stored a number of different card-pool that are sleeved alike in the same deck-box as their\r\nregistered card-pool for this tournament.\r\n• A player accidentally adds a promotional card received at the tournament into their card-pool.\r\n• A player accidentally presents their draft card-pool from a previous day of drafting during day 2 of an\r\nevent.\r\nProcedure and Penalty\r\nIf a card is missing, downgrade to a Caution and make a note of it. The player should be made aware that their\r\ncard-pool does not match their decklist and that they may find a replacement in their own time. There is no\r\nfurther penalty needed unless the player can not present a legal deck for a game due to the missing cards.\r\nIf the player making the error called for a judge as soon as they saw the erroneous card, and no other copies of\r\nthat card (at the same pitch value) have had an impact on the game, issue the player a Warning and remove the\r\nextra card. If this was noticed while the player was drawing or revealing cards from the top of their deck, replace\r\nthe draw/reveal with the next card instead.\r\n20\r\nCHAPTER 4. COMPETITIVE AND PROFESSIONAL - TOURNAMENT INFRACTIONS\r\nIf the illegal cards could not have provided any strategic advantage, such as if they are illegal in the format or for\r\nthe player’s chosen hero, downgrade to a Warning.\r\n4.6. Presenting Cards Error Warning\r\nThe player, by their own action, has a legal decklist and legal card-pool but has presented an illegal set of cards\r\nduring the start-of-game procedure.\r\nPhilosophy\r\nPlayers are responsible for ensuring that the cards that they intend to play the game with follow the rules of the\r\nformat and the start-of-game procedure. When the player presents an illegal set of cards in the start-of-game\r\nprocedure they may gain a state and/or strategic advantage.\r\nPresenting more or fewer cards than the rules of the format specify creates a state advantage because they can\r\ncreate a state of the game that would otherwise not exist, this is especially relevant for strategies that want to thin\r\nout a deck, or fatigue an opponent. Presenting a card that can not legally start the game in play creates a state\r\nadvantage that couldn’t otherwise be gained by following the rules of the game. Presenting legal cards that can’t\r\nstart the game in play together creates an ambiguous situation where the player may gain a strategic advantage by\r\nselecting the best legal option after they’ve gained additional information about the opponent’s starting cards.\r\nPresenting a starting deck with illegal cards creates an incorrect game state and is a common occurrence,\r\nespecially when non-deck cards (equipment/weapons) use the same sleeves and deck cards.\r\nAny advantage gained by presenting more or fewer cards, or presenting an illegal or ambiguous set of cards,\r\nshould be addressed by negating that advantage and educating the player on the proper procedure.\r\nExamples:\r\n• A player presents a 55-card starting deck in a game of Classic Constructed.\r\n• A player presents a 25-card starting deck in a game of Limited.\r\n• A player presents their starting deck which accidentally contains equipment.\r\n• A player presents a starting card that can not legally start the game in the arena.\r\n• A player presents both a 1H and 2H as their starting equipment/weapons.\r\nProcedure and Penalty\r\nIn all cases, issue the player a Warning. During any procedure listed here the player can not request the public\r\ninformation (e.g. the number of cards in the opponent’s deck) and they cannot remove or exchange any legal\r\ncards they’ve presented. This is to prevent them from gaining a strategic advantage based on the current game\r\nstate and public information they should not have at this point in the game.\r\nIf the deck presented (before the game starts) has less than the minimum number of cards required for that\r\nformat, the player chooses a number of cards from their inventory that would increase their deck up to the\r\nminimum number of cards required and they are added to the presented deck. If the player does not have enough\r\nlegal inventory cards that can be added to their presented deck, Cracked Baubles are used instead. If the game is\r\nin progress upgrade to a Game Loss.\r\nIf the deck presented (before the game starts) contains illegal cards, such as cards that can not be included in the\r\nstarting deck, remove the illegal cards from the presented deck, then if the deck presented has less than the\r\nminimum number of cards required for that format, follow the above procedure. If the game is in progress and\r\nthe illegal card was immediately discovered after it has been moved from the deck, remove the illegal card from\r\nthe game, and rewind the game state to just before the illegal card was moved from the deck. If the deck then has\r\nless than the minimum number of cards required for that format upgrade to a Game Loss.\r\n21\r\nCHAPTER 4. COMPETITIVE AND PROFESSIONAL - TOURNAMENT INFRACTIONS\r\nIf the deck presented (before the game starts) has more than the maximum number of cards specified for that\r\nformat (after removing any illegal cards), the player must remove cards from their deck until their deck is equal\r\nto the maximum number of cards specified. If the game is in progress, upgrade to a Game Loss.\r\nIf the player has presented an illegal card to start the game with and that card is on the player’s decklist; if that\r\ncard is a legal deck card, it is put back into the player’s presented deck, otherwise, it is removed from the game.\r\nIf the illegal card is not on the player’s decklist, upgrade to an IP2.\r\nIf the player has presented an ambiguous set of cards to start the game with, issue the player a Warning. The\r\njudge presents the ambiguous set of cards as several legal options the player would have started the game with,\r\nthen the opponent decides on the option for the starting cards for the player; for any remaining cards, if the cards\r\nare legal deck cards, they are put back into the deck, otherwise, they are removed from the game.\r\nAt a professional REL, upgrade to an IP2.\r\n4.7. Draft Procedure Violation Warning / Match Loss\r\nThe player, by their own action, commits a procedural infringement during a draft.\r\nPhilosophy\r\nDrafting involves an additional procedure outside of playing the game which involves strategic elements that can\r\nshape and determine the state of the games subsequently played. As such, it should be moderated with at least the\r\nsame rigor as a game between the players involved in the drafting procedure. Players can gain information, state,\r\nand strategic advantage by failing to abide by the drafting rules. Infractions here are considered as if the player\r\ncommiting the infraction is ignorant of the rules of the draft procedure. Intentionally violating the draft procedure\r\nto gain an advantage is considered Cheating (see Section 5.2 - Cheating).\r\nIn some cases, it’s important that the Judge does not interrupt the player’s train of thought as it would slow down\r\nand disrupt the draft. The Judge should wait until the current pack, or in some cases, the entire draft is finished\r\nbefore implementing a penalty. This is especially the case if a player would be disqualified, so as to not interfere\r\nwith the drafting process.\r\n4.7.1. Draft Procedure Violation - Minor Warning\r\nThe player commits a violation of the draft procedure that can be easily reversed or does not provide a significant\r\nadvantage or compromise the integrity of the draft.\r\nExamples:\r\n• A player passes a pack the wrong way.\r\n• A player picks a card after the draft pick time has expired.\r\n• A player starts looking around the table or at other players at the table.\r\n• A player picks a card, puts it on top of their draft pile, then puts it back into the pack.\r\n• A player picks up and looks at their draft pile while not in an official review period.\r\nProcedure and Penalty\r\nWhen appropriate, pause the draft and issue the player a Warning. Ensure that pausing the draft at the correct\r\ntime will not disrupt the players or the draft process; this could be done during a pick, or at the end of a pick, a\r\npack, or the draft as a whole.\r\n22\r\nCHAPTER 4. COMPETITIVE AND PROFESSIONAL - TOURNAMENT INFRACTIONS\r\n4.7.2. Draft Procedure Violation - Major Match Loss\r\nThe player commits a violation of the draft procedure that seriously and irreversibly compromises the integrity of\r\nthe draft.\r\nExamples:\r\n• A player mixes up the draft pack and their draft pile.\r\n• A player states out loud what they’re currently drafting or planning to draft.\r\n• A player looks at another person’s pack during the draft in order to try and gain information.\r\n• A player rotates a card in the pack upside down to signal the next player what they are drafting.\r\n• A player actively seeks to know what double-faced cards other players have in their pack or have drafted.\r\nProcedure and Penalty\r\nIf the infraction requires immediate attention, pause the draft at the appropriate time and correct any behavior.\r\nThen at the end of the draft, issue the player a Match Loss. This ensures that the player does not influence the\r\ndraft further knowing that they may not personally be affected by their own draft decisions.\r\n4.8. Marked Cards Warning\r\nThe player, by their own action, presents a deck of cards where one or more cards are distinguishable from the\r\nothers while they are in the deck or are face-down.\r\nPlayers must ensure that all cards and card sleeves in their deck are in good condition and do not have markings\r\nor any other features that make them identifiable while in a deck or while face-down. This includes (but is not\r\nlimited to) scuff marks, nail indents, bent corners, and the curvature of the card itself.\r\nPhilosophy\r\nOne of the most important aspects of the game is that no player knows the location of a card once it has been\r\nshuffled into the deck, or can not be differentiated while it is face-down. This is important for ensuring the\r\nintegrity of the hidden information elements of the game. If a player has a marked card, they may be aware of it\r\nwhich gains them a significant information advantage regardless of what the card is. Markings on a sleeved card\r\ncan only be fixed by re-sleeving it to match the rest of the cards in the deck. A damaged, altered, or warped card\r\ncan only be fixed by sleeving the deck in a way that makes it indistinguishable or by replacing the card with\r\nanother version or a proxy (note that proxies are only issued in exceptional circumstances).\r\nSleeves and cards are subject to wear and tear, especially over the course of a tournament. Sleeves can also have\r\nmanufacturing errors that range from immediately visible to barely visible, and can even differ significantly\r\nbetween different packets of sleeves. Cards (especially foiled cards) can warp over time in variable ways outside\r\nof the player’s control. As long as the player is not taking advantage of these marked cards and has not\r\nintentionally marked the cards themselves, the penalty should not be harsh, as long as the marking of the cards\r\ncan be fixed.\r\nPlayers should check their cards and sleeves after every round and replace any that are considered worn or\r\nmarked. If a player is unsure if their cards are in acceptable condition, it’s recommended they check with the\r\nHead Judge. If a player has intentionally marked the cards or has intentionally taken advantage of certain cards\r\nbeing marked, it is considered Cheating (see Section 5.2 - Cheating).\r\n23\r\nCHAPTER 4. COMPETITIVE AND PROFESSIONAL - TOURNAMENT INFRACTIONS\r\nExamples:\r\n• A player has an un-sleeved deck where the color of the backs of the cards is inconsistent. There is no\r\npattern to what cards have what colored backs.\r\n• A player has a sleeved deck where some of the sleeves have bent corners from flicking the cards. There is\r\nno pattern to what cards are in what sleeves.\r\n• A player has a sleeved deck where the image of the back of the sleeves has an inconsistent border width\r\non each card. There is no pattern to what cards are in what sleeves.\r\n• A player has a deck with an even mix of foil and non-foil cards, where the foil cards are slightly warped.\r\nThere is no significant pattern to what cards warped.\r\n• A player has a sleeved deck where a few of the sleeves have a visible bubble on the back. The mark is\r\nclearly a manufacturing error, there is no pattern to what cards are in what sleeves, and no significant\r\ncards are in any of the marked sleeves.\r\n• A player has a fable rarity card that is only available in foil, which has warped and is easily\r\ndistinguishable in the deck.\r\n• A player has 3 of the same promotional cards which are warped and are easily distinguishable in the\r\ndeck.\r\n• A player has a sleeved deck where one of the sleeves has a visible mark on the back. The mark is clearly a\r\nmanufacturing error, but the sleeved card is significant to the strategy of the deck.\r\n• A player has 3 cards of the same name and pitch in sleeves that are a slightly different shade to other\r\nsleeved cards in the deck.\r\nProcedure and Penalty\r\nIn all cases, issue the player a Warning and have them re-sleeve or replace the marked cards and/or the rest of the\r\ncards in their deck to ensure that no cards are considered marked. In exceptional circumstances the Head Judge\r\nmay issue a proxy for the marked cards. The player may not play another match until they’ve addressed the\r\nmarked cards in the deck.\r\nIf the marked cards are identified during a game and the marked cards can be quickly addressed without\r\ndisrupting the game, the player must do so. Otherwise, wait until the player has completed their match before\r\ninforming them of the marked cards and having the player address them.\r\nIf a player is unable to find replacement cards, and can not present a legal deck if they do not, they may replace\r\nany marked deck cards with a Cracked Bauble. If they do, issue them an IP2 and update their decklist in to\r\nmatch.\r\nIf the Head Judge believes that the player would have gained a significant advantage from noticing the the\r\nmarked cards, upgrade to a Match Loss.\r\n4.9. Insufficient Shuffling Warning\r\nThe player, by their own inaction, fails to shuffle a deck of cards to sufficiently randomize the order of the cards.\r\nThere are multiple ways to randomize a deck, and it is encouraged that more than one method is used, such as\r\nriffle, overhand, or wash shuffle, followed by a cut. Pile counting, and deterministic forms of shuffling are not\r\nacceptable alone as a method of randomization. Players are expected to shuffle their deck sufficiently and in an\r\nefficient manner.\r\n24\r\nCHAPTER 4. COMPETITIVE AND PROFESSIONAL - TOURNAMENT INFRACTIONS\r\nPhilosophy\r\nTo ensure fairness, both players’ decks must be sufficiently randomized prior to beginning the game and after\r\nanytime a player looks through the contents of a deck. Insufficient shuffling is when a player fails to sufficiently\r\nrandomize their deck through shuffling, before presenting it to their opponent.\r\nWhen a player shuffles and presents a deck to an opponent the player implies that the deck is thoroughly\r\nrandomized. A player who intentionally does not shuffle their deck sufficiently in order to gain an advantage by\r\nmanipulating the location or distribution of cards in their deck is considered Cheating (see Section 5.2 -\r\nCheating).\r\nExamples:\r\n• A player finishes their start-of-game procedure and riffle shuffles their deck a single time and presents it\r\nto the opponent.\r\n• A player overhand shuffles with the deck facing toward them, and presents it to the opponent\r\n• A player counts their cards out in 6 piles, stacks them together, and presents it to the opponent.\r\n• A player divides their deck by pitch values while side-boarding then does a couple of overhand shuffles\r\nand presents it to the opponent.\r\n• A player forgets to shuffle after searching through their deck during the game.\r\nProcedure and Penalty\r\nIn all cases issue the player a Warning and supervise the player while they shuffle their deck. While supervising\r\nthe shuffling, educate them if they make a mistake in their technique so that they are aware of what is, and isn’t,\r\nan acceptable way to achieve a sufficiently shuffled deck.\r\n4.10. Miscommunication Warning\r\nA player, by their own action or inaction, has incorrectly communicated non-private information or did not\r\ncompletely answer a question about visible and public information, and the opponent takes an action that is\r\naffected by the incorrect or missing information.\r\nPhilosophy\r\nClear and correct communication is an essential part of playing a game of Flesh and Blood. Players are expected\r\nto maintain a clear and correct game state through communication and seek resolution when there is ambiguity or\r\nuncertainty. However, Players often make genuine mistakes regarding communication, especially across cultural\r\nand language barriers, and should not be punished harshly for it.\r\nPlayers may still commit this infraction if they have not verbally communicated, especially when they do not put\r\ncards in the appropriate zones, or do not update markers that represent visible or public information.\r\nA physically ambiguous play-space is not automatically considered a Miscommunication. Judges are encouraged\r\nto instruct Players to fix items in the play-space before they might lead to an infraction.\r\nExamples:\r\n• The player plays an attack action card and says “Attack for four.” The opponent declares two defending\r\ncards to block exactly 4 damage. The player then says “Sorry, I mean attack for three.”\r\n• The player has a permanent with Ward 1 below their hero, partially obstructed by their hand, and their\r\nopponent attacks thinking they do not control any permanents with damage prevention effects.\r\n25\r\nCHAPTER 4. COMPETITIVE AND PROFESSIONAL - TOURNAMENT INFRACTIONS\r\n• A player has one resource and they represent it with dice above their pitch zone. The player plays a card\r\nthat costs 1 resource but does not update the dice. The opponent decides to defend with more cards than\r\nnecessary anticipating the player to play an attack reaction that costs 1.\r\nProcedure and Penalty\r\nIssue the player a Warning. If the game has not progressed too far to be rewound, rewind the game state to the\r\npoint before the affected action (not to the point of miscommunication).\r\n26\r\n5. Competitive and Professional - Conduct Infractions\r\nConduct infractions are infractions of the player’s conduct in relation to both the game and tournament rules and\r\ncover the general behavior expected of a player. Conduct infractions cover both intentional and unintentional\r\nbehaviour.\r\n5.1. Unsporting Conduct Warning / Disqualification\r\nThe player, by their own action, displays negative, offensive, or disruptive behavior that affects the safety or\r\nenjoyment of others, and/or negatively affects the integrity or organization of the event.\r\nUnsporting Conduct is subjective and relative to the context of the event and expectations set out by the\r\nTournament Organizer; it is not the same as a lack of sportsmanship. Ultimately, the Head Judge determines what\r\nconstitutes Unsporting Conduct during an event.\r\nPhilosophy\r\nParticipants of the tournament expect a safe and enjoyable environment, and that the integrity and operation of\r\nthe tournament are upheld to a high standard. By acting in a way that infringes on that expectation, the player has\r\ninfringed on the mission statement of Flesh and Blood. For physical abuse or threatening behavior, see Section\r\n5.3 - Aggressive behavior.\r\n5.1.1. Unsporting Conduct - Minor Warning\r\nThe player acts in a way that negatively impacts one or more people, or disrupts the organization of the\r\ntournament, but does not require investigation or further penalties to correct their behaviour.\r\nExamples:\r\n• A player uses mild-moderate offensive language.\r\n• A player throws their deck in frustration after they have lost a game or match.\r\n• A player does not pick up litter they have created.\r\n• A player shoves other players while moving through crowds.\r\n• A player demands the Head Judge before being given a ruling from the Judge that first arrived at the\r\ntable.\r\n• A player demands that their opponent be given a Warning before a Judge can resolve the issue.\r\n• A player ignores the instruction of a Judge (a player may appeal a ruling before following the\r\ninstruction).\r\nProcedure and Penalty\r\nFirst and foremost, deescalate the situation to ensure that the infringing behavior stops and the safety of other\r\nparticipants is ensured. Educate the player on their actions and issue them a Warning.\r\nFor repeated Unsporting Conduct - Minor infractions, even for different reasons, an upgrade to IP2 then a Game\r\nLoss is recommended.\r\n27\r\nCHAPTER 5. COMPETITIVE AND PROFESSIONAL - CONDUCT INFRACTIONS\r\n5.1.2. Unsporting Conduct - Major Disqualification\r\nThe player acts in a way that negatively impacts one or more people by making them feel harassed, scared,\r\nbelittled, unsafe, or commits acts that disrupt the organization of the tournament.\r\nExamples:\r\n• A player makes a racial remark towards another person.\r\n• A player harasses another person on social media during the event.\r\n• A player takes photos of another person with malicious intent.\r\n• A player wipes a card on their backside or crotch before playing it.\r\n• A player makes another person feel unwelcome at an event because of their sexual orientation or gender\r\nidentity.\r\n• A player refuses to follow the instruction of the Tournament Organizer or Head Judge.\r\nProcedure and Penalty\r\nFirst and foremost, deescalate the situation to ensure that the infringing behavior stops and the safety of other\r\nparticipants are ensured. This typically involves ending the current match they are involved in, separating them\r\nfrom other players by taking them to another area, and educating them on why their behavior is inexcusable and\r\nwhy they are being Disqualified.\r\n5.2. Cheating Disqualification\r\nThe player, by their own intentional action or inaction, lies to a tournament official, breaks rules of the game or\r\ntournament, or intentionally ignores an infraction to their or a teammate’s benefit.\r\nSpecifically, the player must be intentionally trying to gain an advantage from their actions and they must be\r\naware that their actions are prohibited. Both of these conditions must be met for the infraction to be considered\r\nCheating. If either of these conditions is not met, then their actions are not considered cheating and the infraction\r\nwould fall under a different category.\r\nPhilosophy\r\nCheating is one of the most serious infractions a player can commit as it can completely compromise the integrity\r\nof the tournament.\r\nExamples:\r\n• A player lies to a Judge during an investigation, hoping to gain an advantage by the judges ruling.\r\n• A player purposely swaps cards between the arsenal and their hand to gain an advantageous game state.\r\n• A player swaps out cards in their limited card pool with cards they had brought with them to gain an\r\nadvantageous deck.\r\n• A player who has been rule-sharking their opponent intentionally stays silent when their opponent makes\r\na mistake to the player’s advantage.\r\nProcedure and Penalty\r\nDisqualify the player.\r\n28\r\nCHAPTER 5. COMPETITIVE AND PROFESSIONAL - CONDUCT INFRACTIONS\r\n5.3. Aggressive behavior Disqualification\r\nThe player, by their own verbal or physical actions, makes others around them feel threatened.\r\nPhilosophy\r\nAggressive behavior is distinct from Unsporting Conduct in that it involves physical harm or the threat of\r\nphysical harm that compromises the safety of the tournament. There is no tolerance for physical abuse or\r\nintimidation at any kind of event.\r\nExamples:\r\n• A player threatens physical abuse to another player during a match.\r\n• A player violently throws their own or another person’s belongings.\r\n• A player yells at and tries to intimidate a Judge when they are not happy with a ruling outcome.\r\n• A player destroys or attempts to damage tournament materials, such as table or chairs.\r\n• A player swears aggressively at their opponent during or after a match.\r\n• A player tells their opponent that they’re planning to ambush them after the event.\r\nProcedure and Penalty\r\nIn all cases, the safety of every person is paramount. Deescalate the situation, disqualify the player, and have\r\nthem leave the venue by the Tournament Organizer.\r\n5.4. Improperly Determining a Winner Match Loss\r\nThe player, by their own action, uses or offers to use a method other than playing the game to its conclusion to\r\ndetermine the winning player. This includes manipulating an opponent into conceding a match based on the\r\noutcome of such a method.\r\nPhilosophy\r\nIf the player offers or accepts an incentive to determine the outcome of a match, it is considered Bribery (see\r\nSection 5.5 - Bribery). If the player knows that Improperly Determining a Winner is an infraction, it is considered\r\nCheating (see Section 5.2 - Cheating).\r\nExamples:\r\n• A player convinces the opponent they can determine the winner based on a coin flip after time is called in\r\nthe round and the opponent reluctantly agrees.\r\n• Both players agree that the one with the highest life total at the end of the match is the winner of the game\r\nin order to avoid a draw.\r\n• A player remarks on how terrible a draw is and that they should just declare a winner because losing is\r\nbetter than a draw anyway (losses are not better than draws for an individual).\r\nProcedure and Penalty\r\nIf there is time in the round and the match has not concluded, issue the player a Match Loss. If both players\r\ncommit an Improperly Determining a Winner infraction, issue a double Match Loss.\r\nIf the time in the round has expired or the match has concluded with an official result, issue the player(s) a Match\r\nLoss for their next round.\r\n29\r\nCHAPTER 5. COMPETITIVE AND PROFESSIONAL - CONDUCT INFRACTIONS\r\n5.5. Bribery Disqualification\r\nThe player, by their own action, offers or accepts an incentive to concede or otherwise change the outcome of a\r\ngame or match.\r\nPhilosophy\r\nBribery in the game of Flesh and Blood is strictly prohibited as it disrupts the integrity of the tournament. Players\r\nare free to discuss and negotiate prize splits and the handling of prizes after the tournament has concluded, as\r\nlong as does not influence the match result.\r\nAt professional REL, Judges should remind players about the Bribery policy to ensure nobody is ignorant of this\r\nrule, especially before the last round of Swiss.\r\nExamples:\r\n• A player offers their opponent cash to concede.\r\n• A player offers their opponent a split of their eventual prizes to concede.\r\n• A player offers to concede at a later date for a concession now.\r\n• A player offers to concede if they get a cut of the cash prize.\r\n• A group of players negotiates who should concede to get players in certain positions in the tournament\r\nstandings.\r\nProcedure and Penalty\r\nIssue the player a Disqualification.\r\nIf the player commits this infraction out of ignorance, downgrade to a Match Loss.\r\n5.6. Wagering Disqualification\r\nThe player, by their own action, places or offers bets on an aspect of the tournament outcome, match outcome, or\r\nany part of a tournament or match.\r\nBets do not need to be of monetary value to be considered wagering.\r\nPhilosophy\r\nWagering in the game of Flesh and Blood is strictly prohibited as it disrupts the integrity of the tournament.\r\nExamples:\r\n• Two or more spectators wager $10 that a specific player will win the current match.\r\nProcedure and Penalty\r\nIssue the player a Disqualification.\r\nIf the player commits this infraction out of ignorance, downgrade to a Match Loss.\r\n5.7. Theft Disqualification\r\nThe player, by their own action, steals tournament materials or steals another person’s belongings.\r\n30\r\nCHAPTER 5. COMPETITIVE AND PROFESSIONAL - CONDUCT INFRACTIONS\r\nPhilosophy\r\nPlayers are responsible for their own possessions, but players enter a tournament with the expectation that the\r\nmaterial they bring will be safe within reason. Theft of a person’s belongings or tournament materials\r\ncompromises the expectation of safety of the tournament and is strictly prohibited. Judges are encouraged to aid\r\nin the investigation of stolen materials.\r\nExamples:\r\n• A player secretly drops cards from the opponent’s deck on the floor and hides them with the intent of theft.\r\n• A player steals tablecloths or table numbers off a table.\r\n• A player is given prizes, then says to tournament officials that they did not receive prizes with the intent of\r\ntrying to get more.\r\nProcedure and Penalty\r\nIssue the player a Disqualification.\r\nIn cases where there is miscommunication or ignorance involved and the player returns the item, the penalty may\r\nbe downgraded at the discretion of the Head Judge.\r\n5.8. Stalling Disqualification\r\nThe player, by their own action, intentionally slows down the pace of the game to take advantage of a round time\r\nlimit.\r\nPhilosophy\r\nStalling is differentiated from Slow Play by the intent of the player. Stalling assumes the player is intentionally\r\nplaying slow to gain a tournament advantage. If it’s deemed the player is not intentionally playing slow, see\r\nSection 4.3 - Slow Play\r\nExamples:\r\n• A player has a weapon that cost rr to activate and 1 card in hand with pitch value r. They spend an\r\nexcessive amount of time running down the clock ‘thinking’ about what to do.\r\n• A player is ahead in the game and starts to play significantly slower as it gets closer to the end of the\r\nround, making it very hard for the opponent to have a chance of winning.\r\n• A player who repetitively checks either player’s graveyard in a single turn without progressing the game\r\nwith the intention of running down the clock.\r\nProcedure and Penalty\r\nEducate the player that taking advantage of time limits is strictly prohibited and disqualify them from the\r\ntournament.\r\n5.9. Improper Concession Match Loss\r\nA player, by their action, asks for a concession during a match (after presenting their deck) or concedes a match\r\nafter time is called (after taking an action).\r\nSuggesting or pressuring an opponent to concede or to end the game/match, in any form, is considered to be\r\nasking for a concession.\r\n31\r\nCHAPTER 5. COMPETITIVE AND PROFESSIONAL - CONDUCT INFRACTIONS\r\nPhilosophy\r\nPlayers have the right to play the game of Flesh and Blood without being pressured to concede in consideration\r\nof their opponent. Asking for a concession, or pressuring a player to concede or end the game, leads to a poor\r\nplay experience. Players may concede of their own volition up to when time in the round expires, but may not\r\nconcede after they have taken an action thereafter. Conceding based on the outcome of a method other than\r\nplaying the game is considered Improperly Determining a Winner (Section 5.4 - Improperly Determining a\r\nWinner). Offering or accepting an incentive to concede is considered Bribery (Section 5.5 - Bribery).\r\nExamples:\r\n• A player who is worried about the game becoming a draw due to time asks the opponent to concede so at\r\nleast one of them wins.\r\n• After the game is a draw due to time, a player reveals the cards in their hand and tells the opponent that\r\nthey would have one with another turn, in order to coerce them into conceding.\r\n• A player tells the opponent “Come on, man, don’t defend my attack here and let’s finish the game” in an\r\neffort to.\r\nProcedure and Penalty\r\nIf there is time in the round and the match has not concluded, issue the player a Match Loss.\r\nIf the time in the round has expired or the match has concluded with an official result, issue the player a Match\r\nLoss for the next round.\r\nIf the player commits this infraction out of ignorance, downgrade to a Warning.\r\nFor repeat infractions of asking a player to concede, upgrade to a Disqualification.\r\n5.10. Rules Sharking Warning\r\nA player, by their own actions, shows intentional behavior to prevent an opponent from interacting with the game\r\nwhen they can legally do so, or have their opponent commit a Penalty Guidelines.\r\nMethodical or pedantic play is not considered Rules Sharking unless the intention is discerned to be malicious.\r\nThe Head Judge determines what constitutes Rules Sharking during their event.\r\nPhilosophy\r\nPlayers are expected to communicate their actions clearly and to give each other a reasonable opportunity to\r\nfollow the game rules. When a player intentionally influences the opponent to miss an opportunity to interact\r\nwith the game, or to commit an infraction, they may gain an advantage as a result of the game state, or the\r\nprocedures and penalties recommended for that infraction.\r\nWhen a judge rules for a player to receive the penalty for Rules Sharking they should inform the player that if\r\nthey do not play in a less suspicious manner they may be receiving an upgrade. When upgrading they should\r\nhave clear evidence of the Rules Sharking infraction on hand, through interviewing the involved players and/or\r\nspectators.\r\nWhen making a ruling involving Rules Sharking, if it is a case where the player attempts to pass priority for both\r\nplayers and the opponent makes an automated response to this attempt, thereby missing a trigger, the window\r\nand/or trigger are considered to not be missed.\r\n32\r\nCHAPTER 5. COMPETITIVE AND PROFESSIONAL - CONDUCT INFRACTIONS\r\nExamples:\r\n• A player tells their opponent to “Hurry up and finish your turn.”, then when the opponent declares the\r\nend of their turn, the player immediately calls a judge for an opponent’s missed trigger.\r\n• A player immediately declares blocking cards, after an opponent plays an attack, then the player tells the\r\nopponent they’ve missed their attack trigger and calls a judge.\r\nProcedure and Penalty\r\nIf the accusation of Rules Sharking is purely speculative, downgrade to a Caution and educate the players on the\r\nexpectation of play.\r\nIf the player has blatantly and intentionally led the opponent to miss a window of opportunity or to break the\r\nrules, upgrade to a Match Loss.\r\n33\r\nA.
